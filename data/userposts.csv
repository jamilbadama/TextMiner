"2","Hi everyone,  Here is a Dying Light FAQ that's in the works.  These are some of the most frequently asked questions that we have coming from you guys, all in one place, with the answers. We will be updating this list as time goes on. _____________________________________________  Q: How can I play online? My friend and I want to play online together but matchmaking seems to be greyed out. My game type is set to Public. A: What you need to do first is to complete the Prologue first. Once you survive your first night in Dying Light, you will have co-op enabled. From then on, you are good to create terror in the city as a duo.  Q: How can I turn off Be the Zombie Invasions? A: Go to Options > Online > Zombie Invasion â€“ that's the place from which you can turn off the Invasions.  Q: At 73% my game bugs out â€“ I cannot move, I cannot hit zombies, everything looks weird.  A: You are in a trance â€“ it's all part of the game. All I can say is listen and follow your heartâ€¦  Q: I can't link my Xbox account with the dockets.dyinglightgame.com site. A: Log in to your Xbox account through http://live.xbox.com. There might be Terms and Conditions that you might need to accept in order to link your account.  Q: My Dying Light game cannot receive any items from the Dying Light Companion App.  A: First, make sure you are connected to the Internet. At the bottom of the Main menu screen in the Dying Light game, you can see if you are connected with the Techland servers.  Second, check to see if the account that you linked on the Weapon Dockets site is the same as the one you are trying link through the App.  ______  Q. Are you working on Dead Island 2 as well? A: Dead Island IP belongs to Deep Silver. The game is being developed by another company.  Q. How do you plan to support DL after launch? DLCs, bug-fixing, servers, content patches? A. Dying Light is a AAA title, and it's our biggest and most ambitious project yet. As such, it will get all the support it deserves.","Frequently asked questions",2
"3","How about fixing the skills and inventory wipe... its game-breaking and im afraid to play until i know its fixed so i dont risk it happening again. Im on PS4 btw and i was at 53%","Frequently asked questions",3
"4","Please post link to a DETAILED Guide for Companion App...aside from just ""send scouts on missions and send the loot to your Dying Light character...","Frequently asked questions",4
"5","Like Viral said, it would be nice if you guys would have fixed the save game issues because playing this game and restarting it over is just a waste of time and money. Pre-ordering this game was a bad mistake and a waste of money.","Frequently asked questions",5

"9","when will release the season pass ?","Frequently asked questions",9
"10","Yeah you could fix the whole, once you hit LVL 25 survival there's only 5 melee weapons in the game the katana, sacrificial short sword, chupacabra sword, heavy axe, Egyptian Khopesh. and that's it no matter what chest or police van you open that's all there is no hammers, bats, knives,machetes,nothing blunt at all only 2 handguns 1 shotgun and 2 rifles there's really not much in choices after 25 and i'm only on the 2nd main quest i've been running around looking for blueprints, and just killing things, getting air drops, saving people. It's going to be so bland using the same weapons for the rest of the game. There's no way.","Frequently asked questions",10
"11","Q. How do you disrespect your customers so well? A. That's a good question. We so far have not tested the game prio to release to ensure maximum frustration possible, so the bugs are game breaking. Such as save file corruption, crashes, connection issues etc etc. We then add a little insult to injury by ignoring tickets and forum posts, pretending to work a patch which actually has no effect and giving people irrelevant troubleshooting tips that don't work. It's been an astounding success so far.Edited February 5, 2015 by Speeedy14","Frequently asked questions",11

They still have not fixed/removed the most prominent grfx flaw in the game (chromatic aberration) which makes the edges of the screen blurry for no reason and does nothing more than give people headaches. That's the only reason I even bothered to download this patch. I haven't played the game in a month and they can't even fix the damn thing to make it playable..","Frequently asked questions",26

"32","Will Humans every get a well deserved nerfed n rework? and will the uv light every be touched or will hunters forever be uv spam hunted","Frequently asked questions",32
"33","@dasorrowIs every Hunter whiny about what the humans can or cant do? Seriously though, this talk of nerfing things has completely skipped over the most glaring imbalance of all, the range and near unlimited use of the tendrils, range and power of pounce (KO), and the bomber squad, nevermind UV block. I really dont think that any hunter that is yelling about nerfing this or that, (besides legitimate cheating like flare spamming) should have anything to say. You are playing with creative and violent people like me that actively pursue and kill Hunters when it is necessary. Get creative, start doing off the wall things that no-one has done before and enjoy the game as it is made. Since we are playing ""Nerf the Sucker"" why not give hunters a world all to their own that they can pounce on hapless and non-creative humans that wont fight back. Oh wait, we already did. How about nerfing weapons into oblivion so we can't kill said Hunter. Get rid of Airstrikes completely and any weapon above green cant be used. Nope, defeats the purpose of trying for hunters and survivors alike. I know, here is a novel idea!  Lets get back to attacking each other and strategizing our way into a win! Or does every Hunter have the ""Woe is me"" syndrome? Seriously, Humans aren't easy to kill NPCs but neither are the Hunters. Level up and get tough. Enough Satire for me,  Good Night and Good Hunting","Frequently asked questions",33

Level up and get tough. Enough Satire for me,  Good Night and Good HuntingIn the nicest way I can put it, dasorrow does not represent the Night Hunter community. He tends to be overly negative on the BtZ boards as well. Most of us are quite content with the new balancing. Humans and Hunters each have their own powerful weapons/tools, with many of the glitches having been addressed. Duping is still rampant and affects daily BtZ play, but that's something the Devs must deal with. It's out of our hands. That being said, I can't really see Locomotion or Pounce ever being nerfed. They're pretty staple techniques for the Night Hunter. To remove or lessen Pounce would be like asking Humans to lose the UV Light. Together, they serve a balancing purpose as the Sword an Shield of BtZ. Survivor Sense allows Humans to track the Night Hunter effectively, so there's little reason for Locomotion to receive any speed/distance nerfs. The same goes with Horde Spit and UV Block. Hunters need weapons that can be effective against multiple players. Horde Spit is the perfect tool for attacking/separating Humans in 1 Vs. 2+, and UV Block ensures Flammers can't take advantage of the metaphorical UV ""net"" Hunters become trapped in once their shields have been depleted.","Frequently asked questions",34

I just get tired of it and I am not known for keeping my mouth shut. lol  I enjoy the new balancing as well playing as a human, and unfortunately duping is very much still an issue. Realistically speaking, give a guy an inch and he takes a mile. Everyone and their grandmother these days are looking for ways to break the system. A majority of what I wrote was in part to take a stab at what Dasorrow said and see if there would be a paradigm shift through use of sarcasm and satire(?) however I also believe that a majority of people have the ""Screen Syndrome"" where people are perceived as NPCs. I am not going further antagonize the Hunter Community as a whole, I may point out problem children though. lol As it where, locomotion systems, pouncing, DFA, Grappling Hook, etc... are vital to the way we play. It just doesnt make sense to nerf one without the other. This was the main stab I was making here, because in my opinion I think the way things are right now for us is absolutely awesome! A challenge but not impossible. (Save people higher than lvl 30 that I have super problems with attempting to win here.)  Good Night and Good Hunting Doctor Purrington!","Frequently asked questions",35

"60","Will Dying Light ever have more characters to play as? I know Dying Light is focused on Kyle Crane's story, but a lot of gamers, including myself, would love a variety in character customization. Dying Light is not just a solo player game, it is also co-op. Kyle Crane should not be playing with himself (no pun intended). Hence, please add male/female character customization, or add a few male and female characters to play. The quests and skills can still be the same.   I am sure many gamers, not just myself, would really appreciate it and would enjoy the game even more. Dying Light is a great game. Please consider it.

Playing seperate save files with mutiple friends is difficult currently I think additional save profiles would help for people that like with older games such as Dead Island make seperate profiles for seperate fresh restarting of the game to be on level par with playthroughs with friends just starting, rather than joining a friend maxed level best weapons kind of ruins their experience.","Frequently asked questions",64

The thing the people (I employ that word diplomatically) detracting the developers on this point fail to be able to recognize is that their plaints are being heard…that they are unanswered because of the lack of information in their responses; I mean, if I were a game dev (I'm a non-gaming app dev), I honestly don't know how I would respond to, ""dis krap sux—pleez fix.""I'm having a couple of issues with this game, but NO obviously hardware-related problems [that, by their nature, cannot possibly be fixed with any ""patch""], because I saved for a YEAR to be able to buy a decent relatively high-end rig that can HANDLE this game (I actually custom-designed it to surpass the requirements of Watch_Dogs):• Water-Cooled Intel i5 6600K• Gigabyte Z170-HD3P motherboard with Intel chipset• 16 GB Skilljaws SDRAM III• Zotac GTX 970 / 2 GBI'm running the game on max settings, and experience NONE of the supposed ""game-breaking flaws"" that allegedly exist.","Frequently asked questions",80

"82","Hey guys! We've noticed you have a lot of questions. This infographic should clear things up.   ","The Following",2
"83","Will the new enhanced edition have the DLC content and The Following on-disc, or will it simply be a download code for the content?","The Following",3
"84","Dying Light I LOVE IT! Can't wait for the following and the EE gonna be an awesome addition to my gaming library! Gotta say you guys have done an amazing job with taking this awesome game to the next level. What I thought (knew) was going to be a pretty damn cool Zombie game has turned into a must-play AAA game and it will go down as a classic video game that many of the younger gamers out there will remember fondly in 20 years the way I remember the 1st Resident Evil. You guys have done great. And I think we haven't seen anything yet and I know I look forward to the future and what you all do as a Game Developer for many years to come! So thanks and great Job!","The Following",4

However, for those who don't own season pass â€“ you can also get DL: The Following separately if you like.  Once you have it and start playing, you keep all of your inventory and progress from the base game.

You don't own this new edition actually, but any person who buys Dying Light from now on will get this edition. You can get the same content they do if you have the season pass though, so don't worry.","The Following",55

Gotta say you guys have done an amazing job with taking this awesome game to the next level. What I thought (knew) was going to be a pretty damn cool Zombie game has turned into a must-play AAA game and it will go down as a classic video game that many of the younger gamers out there will remember fondly in 20 years the way I remember the 1st Resident Evil. You guys have done great. And I think we haven't seen anything yet and I know I look forward to the future and what you all do as a Game Developer for many years to come! So thanks and great Job!Agree about Dying Light, totally, but not about Resident Evil; Resident Evil (Biohazard in Japan) had absolutely CRAPPY ports to PC until RE5 came out. I bought the Resident Evil bundle on Steam, and love all those games—except RE4, which is virtually unplayable with keyboard/mouse combo. Specific criticisms: Movement and Focus is shot (obviously designed for console play), but HUGE improvement in RE5 and later.","The Following",96

"646","Ideas And Feature Requests For Dying Light Developers.","Feature requests",1
"647","This thread is the place to post all of your ideas and feature requests for Dying Light development team. We cannot promise you we will implement your ideas, since Dying Light is at a stage where most of the features are already defined and implemented, but we'll definitely consider them. Gamers feedback and wishes are something that we want to be aware of as much as possible. If you wish to discuss any of the ideas posted in this thread, please create an appropriate thread in General Discussions forum and only post a link to it in this thread.","Feature requests",2
"648","I would love to see the ability to build or board up a safe house in the coop gameplay... that way you and your 3 friends can roam around find a good building and then hunker down... and then zombies attack your base at night... if it isn't strongly built then they have a chance to get in... at that point you have too fight them off or run... Maybe have a sewer system exit as a get away? Traps just in case they get in? that kind of thing, makes the coop game-play more team oriented... 3 people go out in the day time 1 stands guard they have too pick up supply's to re-enforce the base... At night if one of your guys gets caught out and makes a break for the safe house but ends up attracting a horde... he gets in the safe house but the horde starts attacking the safe house to which you then have too hope your safe house holds (unlikely) or you all escape...  Would this be possible? ","Feature requests",3
"649","I think it would be great to see the following ideas implemented into the online co op version.1. Multiple squads of co ops in the same server. Maybe 4 groups of 4 players.2. Have limited supply drops at random locations that the squads of survivors must fight over or share.3. Have proxy chat so deals between groups can be struck.I see this game as having the potential to be a great online co op vs co op survival game, the only one of its kind if done right. With the release of Dayz and soon to be out H1Z1 I believe Dying light can shine with an online multiplayer co op based verses mode.Thank you for your time  ","Feature requests",4
"650","Suisidel, Your vision seems really fun, looks like a staple of the zombie genre. You'll be happy to hear that some elements of your idea are already present in the game. RUNNERandGUNNER, That is an amazing idea for a co-op vs co-op mode. Implementing that, however, would take a lot of work and balancing, so it is not likely to be considered for the release version. Still, it is an idea I would like to present to the dev team, thank you for your input.","Feature requests",5
"651","My idea is an invading mechanic for 'Be the Zombie' mode. If not present already, i'd really like to see you guys do a take on the invading mechanic that we've been seeing in Dark Souls/Watch Dogs.And this might be a real crowd magnet, since you'd have the first 'Zombie' game to implement such a feature.  on another note, i also remember that back when i used my pre-order key on steam, i got a message showing there was a beta function. Even though this is probably an exclusive thing to the Techland people, Is there perhaps a small chance of us seeing a Beta for the 'Be The Zombie' mode? Because it would be a disaster if that multiplayer mode would drown in glitches/bugs. Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to say that you guys do a bad on testing things. xD But a few hands to help you here and there can always be useful. Besides that, i truely believe you guys are doing a great job, and i can't wait to play your masterpiece. ^^","Feature requests",6
"652","I hope the multi-player implements a system that uses teamwork and makes the game harder when venturing out as if you are Rambo.  Too many online players seem to go off and do their own thing.  I'm hoping with multi-player, if you split up, you're screwed!   I would also love to see fully customized clothes for the characters.  Maybe even some DLC that allows us to look different.  ","Feature requests",7
"653","I would love to see a hardcore mode that requires you to find food, water, bandages, and other survival supply's in single player as well as coop. For those of us players who want a serious chalenge and sense of purpose to your routine. When playing coop I would love to comunicate with my friends about our supply status and strategize when we want to go scavenging, so as not to die of hunger or thirst when hiding from the hoards of zombies outside the front door.","Feature requests",8
"654","Since the games on a pause, let's consider idea's outside the box. Gamers love drama in post apocalyptic series where desperate measures are taken. Given that the game looks a lil similar to the Dead Island franchise, I know you peeps can do better. Your on a new engine made from scraps. Implementing game sturctures where any thing is a weapon is a choice. Anything can be used as a weapon, such as a chupacabra driver. Make this game real as possible and the limits impossible. People have been wanting to play a post apocalyptic game for ages together. Now I heard that the 4 players that are given to us are apart of the story, and they inhabated some kind of immune system like the players on Dead Island. Make it where if you get bitten, you have 10 to 30 minutes to fully develope into a man-eaten riot. Cures can be found only at military breakdowns or helecopter crashes. Give the A.I.'s their own emotion towards sudden outcomes. Scratch all of this but if you can make this into a The Last of Us emotion base feeling, then you people got nothing to worry about.","Feature requests",9

"656","Give us a type of Zombie that is not impossible but near impossible to kill alone  or an area like so, exemple underground sewer's since its a closed area with no outside effects rendering an insane amount of zombies with lots of passage way making it near impossible to explore alone would be awesome! (thinking dude never go in the sewers alone man! or you will die for sure! XD)","Feature requests",11

This would add some realism to the game, a new level of challenge, a strong reason to explore and venture out rather than just waiting at the safe house till morning.As well make it so the food that players pick up slowly rots over time, so there's no point in stocking up food to have a near unlimited supply and not care about looking for food again. There should be a penalty of some sort for dying whether it be all your supplies drop to where you die thus requires the player to run back to pick it up before it despawns to losing a portion of their hunger or to find medicine to heal themselves otherwise suffer from a movement penalty ie. half speed movement","Feature requests",12
"658","as well add an ability like 'Adrenaline mode' where it seems like everything slows down for just like 5 seconds similar to F.E.A.R but with a fairly long cooldown (5 mins as an example) so players cant spam it","Feature requests",13
"659","My concern is the gameplay feeling. Don't implement if it doesn't feel right! You guys delayed the game's release so it could get closer to your vision, and from what I've seen, it's gonna be awesome! Tricky part will the multiplayer (coop or PvP): players tend to play with only what is the best for them, so make sure that what you implement will look important for us to get! For example: saving NPCs... is it only esthetic /RP? Do they help fight back? Do they reward us with a weapon cache? These are elements I hope were considered!  Bre-buy told us the game will have mods...  here's a couple of suggestions that could be interesting to investigate (as for mods), but that are just my quick ideas (pretty sure you guys already had those in brainstorm sessions):> Last surviving team! (choose your parteners, and last team to be alive wins or last team to make it to the morning)> Run around chaos (other players are free to ally or loot you)with  # of kills / scoreboard of the night (I'm pretty sure that type of scoreboard already/should exist)> Protect player X! One player is the target of zombies, help him survive! (he cannot stay in one spot for too long or event X happens) [i don't trust AI for that kind of thing]   Big note: I'd like to quickly share some important aspects of free run I found in Mirror's Edge game:> speed increase (you get your momentum / you try not to stop the flow)> possibility of finishing the game witouth using guns (I did it and it was awesome)> players first play the story, then they learn the paths and beat their timer [The game is not just about the story, it's also about the love the the free run mechanic]> ability to play with the ""next path"" colored in red [so that we don't stumble on having to learn from start where and how I should jump from building A to B // really good way to teach players how the game goes and makes us get in the role of someone that knows what she's doing] To transpose this to Dying Light, I'd say that for a game to be excellent, you must make your vision of the game go through all the aspects you put. As your game is close to free running, I say it's crucial to examine games like MIrror's edge and transpose their best shots and try to avoid the bad angles they could have given.Dying Light is a free run / get objective during the day + survival during night (from what I heard /saw). Meaning you must implement that: Â¤ During the day:> Players feel they are running to their objective / avoiding zombies with agility shortcuts, and where speed is a key element (greater rewards?)(example of a way to give greater rewards: if you come 2min before others: you pack more items. If you come right on time, you barely have time to grab a chocolate bar and a bottle of water)[in the videos I've seen, players don't see to run fast enough for me, or what is just for the demo he didn't go MLG?]> Possibility of evading ALL the zombies.I don't like games that make zombies bites you and leave it OK.> Smashing zombies is nice, but we first need to get in the mood of the game. Make us meet people that survived the zombies, and that want to fight for a reason. It would also be great if they could be glad to be alive, or that feel like they need to hold on tight to life. I don't find interesing games where people stay alive but don't know why (Dead Space 1 > people suicide alot because they lost hope).> Make sure game mechanics implemented are well explained ! Why not have a user manual inside the game (digital) instead of players making a wiki? If I take Majora's Mask on N64 for example, inside the box is a booklet that explains not only the controls, but the lore, key items, the important stuff to know. Sometimes, big games need to be simplified before we head on into specific information.. When players start your game, make sure they get to know the main guidlines (getting supplies / running / surviving) while giving the possibility to have more in-depth information (weapons available / upgrades, classes info, zombie running speed / detect range, effectivemness of crouch's use, does a lit flashlight attract zombies?, etc) Â¤ During the night (I don't know much about this part, so here are suggestions on how the gameplay might be)Make sure players feel AND know they are more safe defending then out there + make them feel better while defending:> Ability to kill LOTS of zombies while being safe, but in a situation where players must stop the infected from doing an action that could change the balance (good example: counter strike zombie mod: zombies try to remove fallen objects from the door to get in. It's kind of easy, and people get overconfident. Then, when 1 object is removed, it often snowballs to the whole human team dying in the 20 following seconds.)> Make sure players know what to do in case of breach> Players have time to craft? (as they run during the day)> Player can recognize special zombie types (so they can set their priorities right)> ? (I don't know more about night time) Thank you for listening (or giving the illusion),Sincerly,a gamer.CESTQUOICA","Feature requests",14
"660","an idea for some DLC, or maybe another pre-order bonus, since there are 5 (i think, might be 4) people to choose from when you start a new game, is the guy with the yellow shirt from the run boy run trailer included? cause i would love to play as him and if he isn't then i would love to be able to get that with pre-order or as DLC. also, are there going to be any physical objects with the special edition? (assuming there is one) because dying light is my favorite game by far and i would love to be able to put something on my games shelf to look at with pride .","Feature requests",15
"661","That's some really awesome ideas coming from this thread, big thank you to all of you! I will try to comment on some of the ideas here, but there is a lot to go through (which is a very good thing). I would love to see a hardcore mode that requires you to find food, water, bandages, and other survival supply's in single player as well as coop. For those of us players who want a serious chalenge and sense of purpose to your routine. When playing coop I would love to comunicate with my friends about our supply status and strategize when we want to go scavenging, so as not to die of hunger or thirst when hiding from the hoards of zombies outside the front door. We already looked in detail at implementing a hunger and thirst system into the game. In the end, we decided to not include it into the game, because it proved to detract too much from gameplay. The player has quite a lot to keep track of, even without the need to constantly look for food and water. The game will still have you scavenging and competing over air supply drops, just without having to be constantly aware of your hunger and thirst levels. As for your co-op/multiplayer ideas, there are some really strong ideas here, keep them coming. On our side, we will be revealing more about co-op and multiplayer features in the future, stay tuned! CESTQUOICA, Thank you for that extensive post. Some of your ideas (or parts of them) are already present in the game (such as tangible rewards for helping NPCs in random encounters), others we will consider. And it's not an illusion, we really want to hear out the gamers' ideas. After all, we are making the game for you.","Feature requests",16
"662","You kno what would be cool is having the option to fight the infection when your screen turns gray. Given that life is gonna be impossible to live in this game, fighting is your only option. Depending on the type of bite, if your character have a huge bite, he or she cannot fight the infection long. If it's only a scratch, make it have a minature timer somewhere in the screen to how many minutes before you turn. If all else fails, then put a bullet in your head.

"663","Some awesome ideas here guys.   The community of this game really knows what they want!  Loving it!!","Feature requests",18
"664","Do not do a hunger/thirst idea as that's DAYZ related and DayZ is already a heavily modded game from the original idea. Please ensure this time with side missions that they are not the same as Dead Island / Riptide where you can do the same thing over and over by giving someone food or bottles to make molotovs. I'd like to see the ability to share meds/food etc with people you meet who need them and gain extra points that way. And also bring the people back to your base or have them tag along helping you with missions so they could be used to help or if you were bad then used as bait. Because the trailer says ""What happens when all that is good in us... Has Gone ? What would that monster look like ?""","Feature requests",19
"665","(1) The more random, dynamic events & zombies, the better. Any dynamic and random elements to the game will add replayability. Random survivors, different zombies appearing in different locations, maybe lootable icons sometimes appear in some locations, and sometimes they don't. Also, make the homes have more lootable spots. The cupboards could have food, check the closets for items and weapons. Please make as many building as possible ones that you can enter. I just bought Watch Dogs, and I thought there would be more buildings we could enter in this ""next-gen experience"", this ""living city"", but it is a boring open-world.  (2) Survivors and Rescues: have rescue-able survivors sometimes appear in groups. For all the videos I've seen of Dying Light, you only find single survivors needing help (the young girl in the closet, the man who barricaded himself in a small building). It would make sense survivors would band together.---Also, you could allow us to escort survivors to safety. It could be our choice. A survivor says ""I need your help"", the player gets a choice whether to help or not. I've continued to play Dead Island: Riptide for a long time, and I just scratch my head in confusion about these survivors. I rescue someone who is stranded on top of a trailer, there are no other living persons in sight and they just say thank you and hand me all their money?! What? With more zombies within hearing distance? I don't even want to take their money! They get rescued, and then they sit there on top of the trailer as I go away. Let's change this. Now, in the Dying Light gameplay I've seen, when you rescue the young girl in the closet, your friend on your walkie-talkie (or whatever) says she'll send help for the girl soon. That makes sense. But, what about other survivors? In Dead Island, some of the survivors you meet you help back to a safe area. I enjoyed these quests. I recognize that escort quests were removed in Dead Island: Riptide due to player feedback (according to a Dead Island designer interview I saw on Youtube, searching for this source would be difficult for me now). But, in Dying Light you could make them optional, you rescue someone, they ask for help, and the players who want the quest can take it, and others can reject the quest.  (3) Playable Characters: are there still 4 planned characters? If so, I hope you make an equal number female and male. Gender equality is making a lot of headway now with games like Borderlands where characters are premade but there is still some choice for both female and male characters, and free gender choice in Skryim, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Diablo, etc. (4) Air drop boxes: In the gameplay I've seen, when you open the supply boxes, you only take one little thing from this box. Is that going to be changed? It's a shame for all the time you guys put into these boxes looking rich. (5) Leg Dismemberment: Will you add leg dismemberment? In the Dead Island games, you can only dismember a leg as a finishing move. I recognize an enemy losing a leg gives the player a big advantage, but you might implement it with some restrictions. (6) Base defense scenarios: Could you add random ones of these? To be forward, I found the base defense events in Dead Island: Riptide to be boring. I dreaded them after awhile, not because they are difficult, but I just didn't find them interesting. It was always the same events through the story, and no unforseen ones. But actually, I wouldn't be disappointed if you removed them all together. (7) Allow us to share supplies with survivors: let us share water bottles, batteries, or whatever with other survivors. It doesn't have to give us xp or money. In Fable 2 and 3 you can give items and gifts to people just to build a closer or more interesting relationship. In Dead Island: Riptide giving items to NPCs for quests (like the pain killers or canned food) gave so much xp it was easy to level up very quickly. In fact, I could get 2 max level players in the time it takes to get 1 max level character in Dead Island (the original), and I much prefer the original games' pacing for leveling. (8) Unlimited secondary leveling: The way of the future for RPGs is unlimited secondary leveling. Diablo 3 has implemented and continued to refine their unlimited secondary leveling called the Paragon level. Borderlands 2 has a similar feature called Badass ranks that is also unlimited. These are account wide benefits, so they levels that are gained through all characters on the account, and help all the characters. Marvel Heroes, a lesser-known but fast in the evolution of action RPGs is about to implement this system, it is called the Omega Leveling System. Marvel Heroes is, in part, designed by David Brevik, a core founder and creator of Diablo. This is an important opportunity for Techland. (9) Elite enemies: You could consider making elite versions of enemies, like in Diablo games. For example, you take any enemy type, and when they are elite, they have more hit points, but they also have extra features. In a way, Dead Island has some of this already implemented: some zombies had helmets that prevented some damage to the head, and some carried weapons. What you could do is allow some zombies to have a weapon that causes additional bleeding (like the ones the player crafts) or has ""affixes"" such as ""zombie can emit a toxic cloud"" or ""zombie enters a rage--moving faster and dealing more damage"". We know that Dying Light already has many varities of zombies, and that these serve to challenge players in new ways, but I thought I'd bring up elite enemies because it might make the game more random and therefore increase it's replayability. (10) Character audio: you could give us a range of voices for the character (at least in pitch or tone). Also, you could have an option called ""character combat speech"" that determines how often the character comments during battle. I'm refering to the things the characters say in Dead Island, like Sam B saying ""That b**** was huge!"" or Xian saying ""The bigger they are...."" So the player would have a choice to turn these off, have them occur rarely or frequently. (11)  Character profile screen: in Borderlands 2, we can always look at our character in the inventory screen. Also, we have a lot of choice in colors and styles. Diablo 3 has this feature as well, with a profile screen and color customizations. It alienates the player from the character to virtually never see them.  (12) Please create some sort of mini-games. This is because it can help create a more dynamic experience, and break up regular gameplay with a variety of things to do. The main reason I'm asking for this is because I spent a lot of time with the fishing mini-game in Torchlight 2. It was so fun, I had much more fish than I'd ever use. Also, from the Fable game series, I liked baking, smithing, bartending, and more. You could be really creative in deciding how these side features fit your game and which ones to choose. You might even have, for example, fishing take place as 3rd person perspective activity. I'd hope for good mini-games though. As I said, I played Watch Dogs, and (for example) their poker mini-game is really slow and boring. I know you guys could really surpass what is done in that game, and I know this because I still play Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide (and I'm exchanging Watch Dogs for credit).","Feature requests",20

I want to see a open world with all most all of the houses, buildings and every infrastructrure open for player to hide and make it a safe place for himself , for example , if i have been chasing by bunch of zombies and i have no ammo or my weapons are not that in good condition , so i should have a option to go into a house or building to protect myself. 2. I want to see varity of Guns in Dying light with better graphics , Dead island guns were not that good .. i hope you guys will improve the weapons graphics . 3.

"667","Heya!  What i'd like to see as a new multiplayer game mode is 'Catch The Thief'. These are the details: 1. The thief starts with a stolen object, which needs to be returned to the thief's homebase.2. The collectors need to chase and recover the stolen item, and attempt to return it to base.3. It is about to get night, so incase the collectors are able to recover the item just before nightfall, they still have to find their way back through the dark. One problem. Zombies are changing, and become much faster and much stronger. (Keep the special fast ones out of it though, otherwise it might be too much for the collectors.4. The thief doesn't get spotted by the infected as fast as the collectors do. And because the thief also has access to items such as firecrackers, flares, (airhorns?), etc. They are in for a bad time. 5. The Collectors are fast runners, but they are bulky, and are unable to climb most obstacles. whereas the thief is very nimble which makes him able to climb or vault over almost any obstacle.  A lot of this can get adjusted of course. xP But tell me what you think.","Feature requests",22

Because the trailer says ""What happens when all that is good in us... Has Gone ? What would that monster look like ?"" We won't be implementing a hunger/thirst mechanic. The game will be actioned-packed enough as it is  We are aiming to make the missions as varied as possible. We will keep the suspense and variety going throughout the whole game. That's a good idea that you have there, but since our main character is a parkour master, not many NPC's would be able to keep up with him. We made the Natural Movement system so that you can feel the character's agility and free-running skills. Having someone â€œslowerâ€ tagging along might diminish that experience a little. In terms of sharing items with your fellow survivors, that is something that will be implemented.  (1) The more random, dynamic events & zombies, (2) Survivors and Rescues:  (3) Playable Characters:  (4) Air drop boxes: (5) Leg Dismemberment:  (6) Base defense scenarios:  (7) Allow us to share supplies with survivors: (8) Unlimited secondary leveling:  (9) Elite enemies:  (10) Character audio:  (11)  Character profile screen: (12) Please create some sort of mini-games.  1. We are aiming to make this as liveable (by zombie apocalypse standards) city as possible. We don't want to stick to the tried and tested â€œopen-worldâ€ action that's taking place on the ground. With our Natural Movement mechanic, our city will be vertically accessible, meaning that you can use the height of the environment/buildings to your advantage. We are aiming to create something really revolutionary here, where our world becomes more organic because of our free flowing movement mechanic.      2. I know what you mean with the â€œrealismâ€ of having a rescued NPC get to a safe point without any player help â€“ it is something that we considered.  3. Dying Light's story is about a specific character, a character whose background and personality will heavily affect the happenings in the quarantine zone. Because of that, we had to create that character. His name is Kyle Crane, and through our story we will closely follow the impact he will have on the city of Harran, and the influence of Harran changing him.4. Royal Palms Resort Guide, you will see for yourself  All I can say is those air drops are VERY important.5. Cutting of legs could really change the combat. We'll have a look at it, and see if we can somehow have the realism without sacrificing gameplay. We don't want everyone to just cut legs in Dying Light 6. Due to our Natural Movement, the game will tend to lean itself towards a fast paced â€œkeep movingâ€ game play, as opposed to static, base centred. I don't think you should worry too much about boring defence missions. 7. In Dying Light sharing supplies with other survivors is one of the ways to increase your renown within the quarantine, and experience the progression from a perfect stranger to a hero of Harran (the City in which the game is set).8. We are always looking for ideas on how to improve replayability - it's one of our main development goals.9. We will have a variety of enemies, and we will give more details on them later on, so stay tuned 10. This one could be handy, and it does seem easy to implement â€“ I'll tell the devs about it.11. More info on customization will be revealed soon, so stay tuned.12. I do agree that mini-games can add a bit of spice to the game, but just like in Hellraid, mini-games might not fit the gameplay. The city is an infected zone, so walking around casually might not be the best idea (there is danger lurking in every corner). There's Natural Movement, Day/Night affecting the gameplay a LOT, crafting, combat, stealth, scavenging, air drops, random encounters etc, so we don't feel the need to break up the gameplay even further with mini-games first of i want to congratulate techland for providing us with a awesome game.... since i have seen trailer and gameplay videos of Dying light i am been mad about this game ... i am waiting for this game from the day i have seen the trailer ..but as i watch some gameplay videos i have seen that this game can be modified into many positive ways..few things which i want to see in Dying light are as follow .. 1. from the day i start playing zombie survival games , i never found enough reality in any of them to have a feeling of that i am not playing the game but actually inside the world of Zombies ...

Our aim is to create a really immersive open world, and because of our Natural Movement system, the world opens up vertically as well â€“ you don't have to be on the ground to find cover. Our map will give you plenty of places to hide if needed, but speed and guile is what will make you live another day â€“ look up, and use the buildings and the environment to plan your escape. 2. Just like with everything else in Dying Light, we want to take it further than what Dead Island offered â€“ including weapon graphics. In terms of variety, I can tell you that there will be over 100 weapons to choose from. 3. Trust me when I say this â€“ there will be plenty of zombies on the streets. Especially in the Night phase, â€œall outâ€ combat is not recommended. And we will make sure that the zombies will not be a walk in the park.4. Because of our Natural Movement system, we want to make the character feel like a parkour agility machine. It is the basis of our gameplay, and having someone not quick might diminish that experience a little. 5. Good idea on making more â€˜realistic' health regenerators. We will give you more details shortly, but all I can say is that â€˜pills and medicine' are very important. Heya!  What i'd like to see as a new multiplayer game mode is 'Catch The Thief'. These are the details: 1.

Otherwise, how are we going to improve? 1&2 We are still in the process of polishing Dying Light, so please be aware that details like these might change.3. Dying Light will offer the option to turn off the gory elements of combat, but it is a game targeted at mature users. The violent and graphic nature of combat serves to really give the players a feeling of real danger and fighting to survive, which is integral to the game. And who is the new guy?

"672","Ideas And Feature Requests For Dying Light Developers.","Feature requests",27
"673","Here's something me and my friends were itching for ever since Dead Island but the game jsut couldn't make it happen. Basicly a race mode. Get from A to B, Sounds simple enough but here's where it can get cooler. Obviously the players race each other. But it's not just first to make it to the finish line wins. You get performance points. Don't get hit, combo kills, special monster kill, stunt executed and stuff liek that will earn you points. Death takes them away or worse yo straight up lose. The one that finishes first gets extra points and the others lose points the more time they take to finish. Winner is the guy with most points at the end of the run. Easy mode : Race during the day, use all weapons. Normal mode: Race during the day, use no weapons. Hard mode: Race during the night, use all weapons. Good Night Good Luck: Race at night with no weapons, death is permament.  Even if it's left to players to decide how they want to play and score each other, the games implimentation to design ""race routes"" through the city is fairly simple and not that time concuming. Plus I figure stuff like this has probably been done already for other features of the game.","Feature requests",28
"674","For the thief maybe an available part of it is be the zombie so there you can see who is faster, your friend, (or anybody else you met on the Internet) or you?And will this game be atleast two player co-op splitscreen? I really wanted this for dead island 1 and riptide. Please? I doubt replacing the Thief would be a good idea, especially since we already have the 'Be the zombie' mode. But i do have another idea that could spike things up. Team Blue will consist out of a 3 or 4 man Goon squad.  Team Red will consist out of 2 thieves.(Perhaps the 'thief' can look like the guy on the right?) Team Green will consist out of 1 special infected.  (it's rather small, but this was the best picture i was able to find.)   The Goons: The 'Goons' are bulky people that rely on brute strenght, And often carry firearms. The 'Goon' will be the only class that has access to firearms when spawning. and they are known to be in groups of 4. Because the 'Goons' aren't able to climb as high as 'Thieves'. They will be restrained to stay on the ground, and often encounter normal infected. This forces the 'Goons' to fight either in melee, making their characters scream and yell out of anger, or use firearms. Doing so makes a lot of noise, which will make it easier for the 'Infected' and 'Thieves' to find out the 'Goon's' location. The 'Goons' objective is to find and hold the supply package which gives them points overtime. Though once they lose control of the supply package, they will recieve an arrow indicator (which is because of the GPS chip that is imbedded), and allows the 'Goons' to find the package with ease.   The Thieves: The 'Thieves' are Slim, and come in fast and small groups of 2. Because they are so lightweight, they are able to traverse the enviroment using almost any type of obstacle.  They excell at sneak and throwing attacks, and are often seen using sharp weapons. Not only are they really fast, they have exceptional stealth abilities which allow them to hide from the infected pretty easily.One of the biggest downsides of the 'Thief' would be the lack of resilience to damage. The 'Thieves' objective is to find and hold the supply package which gives them points overtime. If the 'Thieves' lose control over the package, they will first have to locate the 'Goons' which they can do by chasing down loud noises (for example: gun shots, explosions, loud voices, etc). Once the 'Thieves' have managed to find the Goons, they will see the carrier highlighted with some sort of indicated (Glow, or some sort of reflection flare.)  The Infected: The 'Infected' has a bulky body type, but don't let his looks fool you. He is as resilient as a 'Goon', and as fast as a 'Thief'. Using his scream, he is able to call in surrounding infected which will help him fight the human teams that are currently in the area. Not only does his body allow for loud noises that attract other infected. He is able to use some sort of x-ray vision that allows him to look through nearby walls, but it also allows him to see sound waves that are being made by either the 'Goons' or the 'Thieves'. Do keep in mind that he will have a harder time tracking the Thieves, than he will have when tracking the Goons. While he seems really strong when compared to the other classes. You simply can't forget that he's all on his own (except for the normal infected. :3). His objective is simply put to make kills. Of course, the amount of points he gains with every kill will differ from each class, but that can be discussed later. (sub tactic: The 'Infected' could kill the package carrier, and then swarm the place with normal infected. That way, he can hide somewhere while he waits for somebody to grab the bait. )    The only requirement for this game mode would be grouped matchmaking, but with a twist. Since all 3 teams have a different amount of players. I wish to make it so that lone wolves, 2 man groups, and 4 man groups can play together in one match. And if done correctly, we shouldn't see any problems with balancing.","Feature requests",29

"682","Alright! So I've seen the 2014 trailer viewed at E3 and I love it. The creativity and elements brought into action makes me think you guys and girls have no problem on your hand. What questions me are classes. I mean goons are like people who are just brought out into the world , like average people, and thieves are people who are athletic. Imma be honest here but the class set up seems like ""Brink"". I love the game and can kill a whole team jus by sliding, but when I see the class which is called goons, who are able to wield range weapons such as firearms, it makes me wonder why not the other classes? Almost any human being can wield a weapon. When it comes to an apocalypse, I know their has to be a leader pulling the strings, but classes make it more diplomatic where you question ""is my character suitable for this or that type of job?"" I love what your doing to the game, it's just classes don't make the game feel as free going as someone would want it to be. RULES...","Feature requests",37

"685","Thanks for all your input guys â€“ a lot of great ideas there! We really are enjoying reading your ideas different multiplayer modes, so please keep them coming. HaNYolO, thanks for the imagery as well.  Dying light has some good parkour elements, and I think there might be some missions that require you to go FASTERSo maybe add some vehicles?ADD splitscreen this gives the game more better quality Although cars are cool, we don't want to implement them as we really want to focus on the Natural movement system. After all, if you could parkour like a champion, would you rather make a run for it or use a car? Harran is littered with cars, and originally we intended to give the players ability to drive. However, during testing, it turned out that our Natural Movement simply eliminates the need for driving. There was just no incentive to limit yourself to driving, when you could get anywhere quickly and efficiently using Natural Movement. In terms of split-screen, at the moment we are not implementing a split-screen option. There's a lot of things that need to be done under the hood to get that feature working well, and looking at the current gaming trends, it seems split-screen is something that's slowly fading away. It's something that we decided not to pursue. What would be really cool is a hard mode where if you die you start completely over no second life's I've been wanting a game with this as a mode be the first techlandItcwould definitely put more into trying to survive not just running out you doe and restart at check points even make it a survival modeAlright let me try to sum this up abit.

If you are able to complete the story a hidden mod or weapon will be unlocked where you can unleash mayhem with . We are aware more and more players expect this kind of challenge from modern games, so we will seriously consider adding such features. However, we haven't made the final decision yet. I personally would love to see the ability to throw animal meat into a crowd of zombies to distract them.Another awesome thing would be the ability to barricade a door with anything that's near the door, obviously it wouldn't last forever and eventually the zombies could bash the door down. This would add a intensity to the game, a real feeling of being trapped, or desperation of escape. We have a similar mechanic to your â€œthrowing meat as a distractionâ€ idea â€“ you will be able to throw firecrackers as a distraction. In terms of barricades, it's something that goes a bit against our Natural Movement system. Your character's main strength is his speed and agility â€“ use that to your advantage to get out of sticky situations.  I'm just shooting for the stars here, but here are a few ideas.1. I heard about character customization.

What I can tell you though, is that Dying Light's story revolves around a specific character named Kyle Crane. We decided to go with a deep story, where the character's personality and background will heavily influence the others in City's quarantine zone. 2. With nudity, we don't plan to show any unnecessary bareness.3. The city of Harran is under strict quarantine, which makes leaving the city impossible for those trapped inside. Also, any supplies for the quarantine zone will come from air drops, so hunting for food is something that is not an option.4. At the present moment, there won't be any cross-bows implemented. However, we have discussed them in the past, so they might make it into the game. No promises though. 5. Your character's main talents are speed and agility. Best thing to do is run.  Let's keep this discussion going. It really is a goldmine of ideas.","Feature requests",40

"687","So about traveling. I'm hearing some odd ideals for adding some type of transportation. Adding it in the game isn't needed. But implementing elevators might give the game more of a free roam vibe in buildings. The key thing is adventuring. Once I get the game, I'm settling down in the most dangerous area I can find. Setting up my base, and keeping it a personal secret. Adding buildable traps wouldn't be a bad idea for gamers who just wanna settle down and grab the supply drops closer to their position. Oh! so I saw what's in the supply case but only see the gamer grab some type of green chip, and all around the chip is supply's. What so important abt the chip?

"696","Grappling hook adjustment: Instead of it being a tool to pull yourself towards other locations, it would be a lot interesting to be able to use the grappling hook as a swinging tool instead. (for example: Bionic Commando.)I'm not sure if this is already possible, but perhaps being able to pull a zombie/human towards the player could also be an option. Heck, it would be even cooler if you'd be able to use your weapon or crash into a zombie while in mid swing. (Not enough games with swinging mechanics. )  I really think the current grappling hook looks out of place. If it had some automated reeling system, then it might have come over a bit more believable, but i don't think it would look good. :/ What does the rest of you think about the current grappling hook? *Edit I have looked more into the grappling hook, and i actually gotta say that i really do hate how it works. :/ Everything else has been perfect in Dying Light for me so far, except this one thing.

"697","You mentioned an expanding zone item mechanic â€“ could you give me a bit more info on that? So what I mean in expanding zone items, are mission items that make you expand to other zones when completeing a certain task. Weather the zone is difficult, or daunting toward others, your gonna have to go to that area for a certain mission...You guys are the geniuses lol I have no clue what I'm talking abt here. Buildings that are explorable is something we want more than anything. The animation where the protagonist tries to open the door is something we want but make to where some doors will open. Just put a lot of animation in the game lol it looks more realistic. Oh! So I like it where the zombies bites you, but is their a mechanic where you struggle not to get bitten? I mean it'll drain your strength to a point, but keeping zombies off is a priority. I love the hand to hand combat when it comes to zombies. Just punching a body bag is better than a live one lmao, but reLly! The elbow drop was gold. I mean if you can add more creative ways to hand fight zombies, that'll be awesome. Oh! And traveling on a bike wouldn't be a bad ideal. Just make it a down hill only tool that gets you to someplace horrifying. I know the games gonna be scary as chupacabra and that's what the fans want.

"713","I'm curious about game difficulty in Dead Island/Riptide there wasn't one and the zombies leveled with you and when you die you lost money and started from the last checkpoint. However; Dead Island/Riptide was more 'fight or die' while Dying Light seems to be more 'flee or die' especially at night so how will death be handled?  If you die will you respawn at sunrise and what are the consequences of death do you lose money, xp, items or all the above? I suggest just having one static difficulty level as the game looks great as it is and you give us the tools to survive. I'm also curious about the day/night cycle how long is it in real time from sunrise to sunset and then again from sunset to sunrise?  I did see the mini-map is there plans to introduce a cell phone that gives the time and maybe with a gps component that serves as a map?  Though that might be a bad idea to 'take a break to check your phone' could break the immersion. As a single-player I wonder how you plan to balance single vs. multiplayer gameplay. I guess my post has more questions than suggestions I'm grateful for your reading just the same and am looking forward to Dying Light.  ","Feature requests",68

"721","Woot Gold stars folks...Well I've have a huge brain...so here I go go. So I've seen the combat when zombies take a hit in certain areas and I kno it affects the way they walk or swing in some form of way. So how abt putting in a combat system where we get to betray the bones wit our bear hands, depending on the area that's weaker on the body. Zombies are weak feeble creatures when they start to deteriorate in the hot sun. Depending on if the smell of the corpse, let it affect our player. The more death like smell, the more woosey we get. Adding gas masks to our players load out will make it where our players are secure and ready for upcoming environments. This makes the game more real life to where the daring goes for the glory and the smarts stay secure. ------------- Ok! So I've been thinking on the FPS movement. It's perfect for this title. Sprinting and shooting gives us some quick pops to the zombies ahead of us, making a secure path towards our goals. Oh! Adding flashlights to our weapon, is that already in the game or no? I kno some lights can blind a zombie temp, and gives us an opening shot. Take some zombie flashes on the way down some street or something lol. I kno it's gonna be scary as chupacabra running away from the infected at night, and I most def respect that. Now abt that if you die, you gotta make a new character. This would be epic; making the chances of anyone going out at night slim. People will now take the night more seriously. It's only daring that gets people far in situations like this.","Feature requests",76

To distract those pesky zombies, you'll be able to throw fireworks to lure them away from where you want to go. Nice clean getaway - here we come! I have a question, how would gameplay and graphics change from ps3 and ps4 on Dying Light? Our aim is to make the Dying Light gameplay experience exactly the same across all platforms. While the PS3 version might not look as good as the PS4, the gameplay itself will still be the same. We put a lot of effort to preserve elements like the amount of enemies simultaneously on screen - something that would normally get scaled down for last-gen games. We are convinced last-gen users will not lose out on the game, gameplay-wise. Ok! So I've been thinking on the FPS movement. It's perfect for this title.

So let's talk abt strength. I kno certain zeds have this overwhelming strength pattern that we noobs can never beat. Are their gonna be weapons that can somehow overpower them. I'm tlking abt house old items such as: THE WHOLE BUILDING COLLASPING ON IT...I mean I'll do whatever it takes to take down a brute. When it comes to saving people, I'm the hero in my group. I saw how weapons affect a players status when getting hit by blunt/sharp objects; when fighting thugs on the bridge.that was crazy in a way that they looked and seemed stronger than us. I can understand a zeds chupacabra strength hendering my movement, but normal people...Naw. It depends on speed and manuverbility to dodge on going punches that swing towards you. Oh! I know we get tired when fighting, so does the AI also have the same traits or no? Is it my curse to say chupracabra in everyone of my post lol why......Oh! The zombie moans.

"728","I'd like it when/if weapons break, said item is dropped by your character and cannot be picked up again. Basically, the item is removed from your inventory. I really liked that type of system in the Dark Cloud series. I did not like what was done with Dead Island, other than 2 or 3 weapons ( not counting explosives >.> ), if you completely depleted the condition of your weapon you still got to keep it and could repair it any time. I found myself throwing away my â€œbrokenâ€ weapons as a way of penalizing myself for using up all its condition, i.e. to recreate the feel of having actually broken the weapon beyond repair. As such, if possible, I'd like such a system implemented. This is, of course, assuming such a system has not already been implemented.Edited June 18, 2014 by Sohisohi","Feature requests",83

Maybe you have anywhere from 1-4 or 1-6 and you pick a building. you build it up during day and get weapons like everyone has a job one gets weapons one gets materials one builds maybe like classes a builder scavenger etc. and at night you defend your base. Maybe if the infected swarm in and basically take over you have to cut your losses, grab what you can and run and hope no one dies or you lose to much and find a new home. I would love to have this game mode. Glad I finally found this forum lol. Couldn't find it last night. Or maybe it was right there in my face but the lack of sleep made me completely look over it.

Weather it's a 5 man team or not, make it where it sounds like if you need a leader in certain outcomes, we'll provide one. Zombies are greater in numbers, strength, and control; while players are greater in skill, mind, and situational awareness at times. The fifth wheel can be implemented to only stay at the base and fortify the area until their return. The fith charachter could provide intel, drop locations, food sources, closest power exzilleratiors, and or new locations to set up base.

O.o As far as i can tell, PC is already miles ahead of the new consoles, but most PC exclusive games that feature co-op stay true to the 4 player formula. The reason of this is because it is stable, and easier to balance than if you had more. Also, more people doesn't mean it will be more fun. :3 (Not trying to start a flame war on consoles, even though it might seem like that.) I could have misunderstood your post, because i'm not sure if you are talking about the main co-op mode, or an additional game mode.If the latter, could you quote the post that you were refferring too?  (If it is a team vs team thing you are talking about, than i can understand why you'd want to have 5 people in each team.)","Feature requests",92

"743","I first of i want to congratulate techland for providing us with a awesome game.... since i have seen trailer and gameplay videos of Dying light i am been mad about this game ... i am waiting for this game from the day i have seen the trailer ..but as i watch some gameplay videos i have seen that this game can be modified into many positive ways..few things which i want to see in Dying light are as follow .. 1. from the day i start playing zombie survival games , i never found enough reality in any of them to have a feeling of that i am not playing the game but actually inside the world of Zombies ... I want to see a open world with all most all of the houses, buildings and every infrastructrure open for player to hide and make it a safe place for himself , for example , if i have been chasing by bunch of zombies and i have no ammo or my weapons are not that in good condition , so i should have a option to go into a house or building to protect myself. 2. I want to see varity of Guns in Dying light with better graphics , Dead island guns were not that good .. i hope you guys will improve the weapons graphics . 3. I wanted to see more Zombies on Streets so for a player it gets harder to fight all of them , in order to get away ... and also the damage given by zombies should be more than what we saw in dead island series .. 4. I wish to see many sub missions in dying light , rescue and surviver missions ..and this time please put the option to protect the surviver until he reach on some safe house . 5. please dont let soft drinks , water , food stuff regenerate health , make it more realistic .. .and bring the idea of pills , in that case survival will be more hard , if someone is hurt than he has to look for pills in order to survive . that will make game more interesting and hard .I agree on: 1245  Especially 5. Like how in the damn World do you heal bloody wounds with an candybar.  treatments would be betterAnd food should lower the hunger lvl. Water should be precius to the player. And as for the supply drops?!? I hear you just Get one single weapon......... -_____- all that time sacrafise for this?! The abillity to change your outfit would be cool.And just sayin lol why do i always see characters in T-shirts and shorts?! This ai'nt how you survive! Get some none bumpy armor or an sheild. And also as always im tired of having to always only upgrade weapons to whack zombies zombies and more zombies. Isnt this gettin old?

"754","What do you mean, ""outdated for the new consoles"" ? O.o As far as i can tell, PC is already miles ahead of the new consoles, but most PC exclusive games that feature co-op stay true to the 4 player formula. The reason of this is because it is stable, and easier to balance than if you had more. Also, more people doesn't mean it will be more fun. :3 (Not trying to start a flame war on consoles, even though it might seem like that.) I could have misunderstood your post, because i'm not sure if you are talking about the main co-op mode, or an additional game mode.If the latter, could you quote the post that you were refferring too?  (If it is a team vs team thing you are talking about, than i can understand why you'd want to have 5 people in each team.) Yes! The team vs team multiplayer coop. 4 players is gonna be boring like the multiplayer of RE6. The coop campaign was heaven, but multiplayer had people on the downside.","Feature requests",109

Snow? Seasons Perhaps?-A Custom BGM Playlist?, this will be easy to add for PC gamers but it may be a bit challenging for console. This idea seems a bit ambitious but it'll be amazing if Techland pull this off. (By BGM I mean BackGround Music)-Clans, this idea could be added to add different groups of people that fight by each other, getting rid of other clans.-Outfits Having Perks, most people said that there would be no need to add outfits or customization options for clothes as they have no game changing abilities, this idea can hopefully change some peoples minds. The perks could be jumping further, getting stunned by zombies less or they can have penalties in exchange for extremely helpful perks.-Sanity, Killing zombies may make you less sane and nauseous, maybe crafting a torch of some sort to replenish it. -Emblems, Nearly everyone likes to make things so they feel that things belong to them, maybe introducing these to clan and further on.  Hope you feel these ideas have some sense.  Pece XDEdited June 26, 2014 by Mrgtagenius1","Feature requests",137

"798","Hey guys,  Thank you all for the comments, suggestions, and just general chit-chat - I like it  All right, let's answer some questions here. Well, the virus could infect animals later in the game, or not at all. You never know. Infected animals - interesting idea. That would be really cool to see. Question to you guys - what sort of infected animals could there be in a city? Keep in mind they have to fit with the Dying Light theme, and be a bit on the ""horror"" side (infected squirrels might be out of the question here). I'll pass on this one to the devs, and see what we can do. No promises though.   Will there be like actual missions instead of just getting the supply drop everytime? Like, going outside the town and climb some mountains where the undead wild can attack you. I don't really like the idea of being in the same area over and over. Just saying   I know what you're saying Reticled. Trust us, you won't be doing the same thing over and over. We will keep things varied and interesting. Check out my weapon idea post (http://forum.techland.pl/topic/18-ideas-and-feature-requests-for-dying-light-developers/?p=404). I have some non-lethal future weapons in there such as the X12 and the X26. I'll pass on the Weapon idea to the devs. I know that they are always on the hunt for new weapons ideas. Request: can a minecraft map come out like with the DLC or something? Or it comes out seperately on the website download? Idk Square-shaped Dying Light - that's crazy. And crazy is what I like.I really don't think it will happen Arolzentai, but I will pass it on to the guys.   1 - You said that have much zombies types, but i like to know if some of this zombies will have a special characteristic, like Left 4 Dead, and in part, Dead Island, Zombies that explode, zombies that catch you and drag you to far away, or the Boomer, that vomits a liquid in you that attracts a horde of zombies. 2 - Someone has commented a system of player vs. player, will be cool you use the zombies in your favor, like attract zombies to surround the enemy team or simply delay them to the objective, like air supplies.3 - I like the challenge of the night, just the fact of have night and the zombies' change is awesome.

And sorry if my english was bad.  Hi williamcms 1. Yes, there will be special zombies - there won't be just your standard crawlers. Check out some of our gameplay footage to see some of the other zombies that we have on offer.2. We always like hearing suggestions on multiplayer gameplay. In the single player game, you will be able to use zombies to your advantage, so in a potential player vs player mode, we could use this idea.3. Ah yes, the flashlight. It will be your biggest friend and enemy at the same time. Don't worry about mastering weapons - it's all about mastering the flashlight...4. Not sure about Brazil my friend, but we will make sure that we can deliver the game to everyone no matter where they are. And thanks for the compliments. Oh chupacabra, i just came up with something that could possible make the game ten times more sick. Different fighting styles that you can learn from well hidden books, NPC's, or maybe even learn different fighting styles when doing certain base attacks. As an example: 1.

What do the rest of you guys think about this? I think it adds more to the customisation of your character and playstyle. I don't know much about marshal arts either (I did karate for about 4 weeks when I was 7 years old), but I do know that I like this idea. I can see this giving the game more kick (no pun intended) in terms of playability, and possibly replayabilty. It would also encourage players to ""explore"" the fighting mechanic. I'm not talking about becoming a full-blown black belt master, but a few handy moves here and there couldn't go astray. Now, I don't the practicalities of designing and implementing this in the game (within our timeframe), but will definitely pass this on to the devs.  All i know, is that the game looks amazing and that techland better not delay the game in 2015 because i would be really sad.  Bar a zombie apocalypse, the game is set for February 2015. Heya i know that it is confirmed that there will be ranged weapons such as guns but will there also be bows and/or crossbows?

Please change dying light dead island was the past, this game is the future and we aren't looking for dead island features, new features.1: when he dies add a little animation of how he dies, maybe like a horror, first person runner, app called Into The Dead, if you die, you see the zombie eating you and the blood splatters on the (screen) which would give it some better way to dies instead of seconds to respawn:52:So a thug zombie wacks him, since the protagonist is like a ninja or a traceur(parkour practitioner) then maybe he could kip-up. It sounds weird but i think you have seen it in most movies. Here is how the kip up works. First the protagonist puts his feet close to his chest, the feet are aiming at the sky and then he shoots out his feet and his whole body itself flies and he lands on the ground. If this makes the game too easy add it as a skill. Or if that's too easy make it like 2-3 seconds he is unconscious on the floor and 1-2 seconds he does the kip up so it will be about 3-5 seconds he will stand up, and if it is a skill maybe add some upgrade to it like maybe when you first get the skill it takes 5 seconds to kip-up then if you upgrade it it takes like 4 seconds and when you upgrade it the last time it is like 3 seconds. I think this is better for dying light, and the into the dead animation, really scared me at the beginning of into the dead Sorry if you thought my postt is useless because it is devastatingly long and here is the kip-up(Tutorial)Edited June 30, 2014 by Arolzentai","Feature requests",156
"802","Ideas And Feature Requests For Dying Light Developers.","Feature requests",157
"803","I was thinking about playing this game and I thought with all of this hopping to roof tops style it would be cool if there was a legit ""floor is lava"" mode, some kind of moded mode where if you touch the ground you die. Maybe at the same time zombies can still climb up and chase you, or you could race against a friend along roof tops from checkpoint to checkpoint. I think that would be something so fresh that people would love.That would be cool but a bit easy, such as it is just staying on rooftops maybe if the rooftops were like really far from eachother then this would be hard, and the intensity you get from those zombies you get chasing you, plus your friend trying to pass you, that's three things you should be worried about, hope no one has anger issues, this would drive them crazy. Overall that is a great idea i really like this. ","Feature requests",158
"804","Another idea, as with hellraid, make a mobile game of it but with less missions and ok graphics but dying light itself has wonderful graphics. Just saying you would get money on the game and the mobile device, since most people use mobile devices, and what is better than dying light on the go?","Feature requests",159

I would really like to see a bow in action, it's pretty popular, i think it would be the best survival weapon in the game like compound bow in crysis3 or recurve bow in far cry3, i mean there is no such feeling as putting an arrow to the zombie's head, correct me if i'm wrong  ","Feature requests",161

"808","I'm back! I've seen some weird posts ups abt bow's which peps keep bragging abt. Just drop it folks. Animals caught my eye, and the game fits a monkeys(the last of us), bats,dogs,birds eye,and...That's abt it. Now range weapons are awesome and all but how abt adding a Hunter rifle in the game. It's better to scout out an area before you enter it. Bolt action snipers in any zombie outbreak is very common. If it's anyway to add the weapons found in State of decay, that would be good. Not all of them, but some of them. ","Feature requests",163

Maybe at the same time zombies can still climb up and chase you, or you could race against a friend along roof tops from checkpoint to checkpoint. I think that would be something so fresh that people would love. Interesting idea. Seems like a good ""race against the clock"" type of mode, especially against another player. This one is going to the devs.  Hmmm what about the death of the protagonist I saw a gameplay of open world and the guy dies just like dead island. The zombie with the(sledgehammer, axe, rock???) thing wacked the guy and I thought oh how will he stand back up, maybe a kip up? Good point on the kip-up Arolzentai. It would a bit more of a parkour feel to it, and help you feel the action a bit more. Now, I don't know how hard/easy it will be to implement from an animaton/code point of view, so no promises on that, but you did make a good suggestion here.  I'm giving you a +1 for that one. Another idea, as with hellraid, make a mobile game of it but with less missions and ok graphics but dying light itself has wonderful graphics. Just saying you would get money on the game and the mobile device, since most people use mobile devices, and what is better than dying light on the go? Dying Light on the go sounds like a hit. You could be doing parkour while doing parkour - it's almost like Inception.  If we can do this is another matter - controls on the phone are a different beast to the ones on PC and console, but it's worthwhile to have a think about it. I'll this on. What do you guys think about a flare gun? Use it to burn the zombies or use it to mark your location in Multiplayer. Suggestions? Opinions? I like it. Straight away, I'm seeing the flare gun as a positive (burn zombies, mark a spot, light up the area, use it as a distraction) but also a negative (revealing your location, attracting zombies).  This could be a doozie.hi everybody, i really like the idea of this game, so personally my request is about ranged weapons...

Honestly, we haven't made a decision yet if we will have a bow in the game - it's not ruled out, but it's not confirmed either. It's a 50/50 at this stage. There is a better feeling called 'Hitting a zombie in the head with a sledge hammer. :3 A lot more reliable than an arrow that will most likely break on impact. It's all about that crunch sound isn't it...  I'm back!

Anyone else has ideas for zombie animals? You mentioned weapons from State of Decay - any particular ones you liked?","Feature requests",164
"810","I'm not sure if this was already mentioned but, If I were u it would be really cool to add some acids or some fast flesh corroding concoction like when u spray it on zombies it will  like corrode their head some will melt some will evaporate just to show how incredibly corrosive the acid is, but I wouldn't want it to be like a consumable like in a flask and u throw it, it breaks, do its stuff, and gone, I'm not saying it shouldn't be in a flask to begin with cause how can u carry it while trying to find something to combine it anyway? What I'm saying is, the ""acid"" can be found in a flask or whatever u like, and can be combined like lets say to a samurai sword that when u slice a zombie with it, if u kill it or not, the ""sliced"" area/part will start corroding the flesh(and bones if u want), or some sort of liquid spraying armament like a watergun for example. the watergun example would not be cool to carry around, maybe the pesticide gun that are being used in farms? or probably the case of the flamethrower w/out the flame just the acid being sprayed. much like the ""fire knife"" and the electric axe we've seen in game demo vids, the fire/electricity doesn't die/worn out, hm for the VFX on the weapon maybe some like greenish goo with bits of tiny bubbles and some smoke eminating from it, like from the movie ALIEN http://bit.ly/1odKTgD but faster flowing, in the movie its too sticky and dense looking, the acid should be more free flowing, more like motor-oil or brake fluid likeSummary: If we understand each other, if combined to a weapon e.i. a samurai sword, it lasts unlimited like the fire knife & electric axe in game demos, drips like brake fluid thats greenish(or any hue of green u like) with tiny bit of bubbles and some smoke emanating from the acid, and can also be put to a sprayer for mid range face melting I hope I didn't messed up on the explanation.Edited July 3, 2014 by Obamu","Feature requests",165
"811","Loot rarity events. A randomized crate drop event will appear sometimes and it will leave a crate delievered containing a special rare and epic item. Maybe a powerful or hard to find weapon, or a special attachment to a weapon to make it better, or a rare component to craft an awesome item, that the player must get to quickly before the bandits otherwise he will have to fight them for it and one of them may use it against them if they already picked it up. Likewise if the player gets there first they can use it on the oncoming bandits or flee with their new item before they are slaughtered and looted.I also want to add to my previous suggestion that this doesnt tie into missions like that of the gameplay trailer but rather a random thing when you are just exploring that you can either ignore in order to persue a mission because you may not even be able to handle this event just yet if you do have to confront bandits or ignore the campaign temporarily to attempt and get this mystery item(s). Also they will not activate during missions. As well it may hold blueprints to craft certain weapons that you couldnt craft otherwise without, maybe even crafting together 2 already crafted items to make a super crafted item. Ex: You take items and you use them to craft that Electrified Machete. You take some more and craft the Flaming Axe. With this blueprint you can combine those 2 already crafted items into something even more amazing.Another addition is collectibles. The game seems to have a strong exploration based platform, so adding collectibles around the world as an incentive to explore would be a nice addition. It could range from different skins for weapons, article clippings about the outbreak, written notes from past surivors that lead to their cache of survival gear before they died, trophies that unlock concept art or just of 3D rendered models of in-game characters to view in some Gallery.","Feature requests",166
"812","SUGGESTIONS: *- Much animation, such as takedown attack animations.- Add unique weapons in the game.- Make it so like it's a free world, go where ever you wanna go, not a one-path straight forward game.- Don't make your team-NPC's lazy. In the beginning a guy is just telling the objective and once he's finished, he's just going to sit in his chair looking at the sunset. Make it so he's checking a radar, doing something, you know.- When you get cash (put cash in the drops), make it so you can buy weapons from it.- Let the player have their own profile in the start-menu. Let the player be able to equip weapons and let them choose his weapons to use for that certain mission from the start-menu.- Missions in buildings when it's dark. I like being scared.- Make the zombies more scarier with more blood.- Make some zombies bigger than the player.- Make some zombies very fast.- I really like the roll animation, do more of that! Very unique.- Make a large kind of various zombie skins. I've seen the demo and I see very often the same zombie walking by but that's just the demo.- Make it so the player goes outside the city, like activating something inside the forests and then going back to the city.- Do something with MMA takedowns. Some of them are really cool to have in this game and to use it on a zombie. You guys can check out this video: .- Brute takedowns. I wanna see some heavy takedowns, like this takedown: .- Weaponwheel. That's a must-have for 2014+ games. It's fast, easy and clear.- If you don't have a weapon or flashlight, you will be given a glowstick in your inventory for when it gets darker. Once used, you have to deal with the darkness without help by a glowstick or flashlight until you find one.- I mentioned before, the custom controls. I really hope this will make its way to Dying Light as this is a great feature to have.- A zoom function to notice zombies in the distance.- In Co-op mode, do not let the players spawn behind eachother. Make it so players have to search for eachother.- PRE-ORDER DLC: Make it so the co-op zombie can climb walls and walk on the ceiling. That would be terrifying!- Ghost girl jumpscares. Let her stand in a doorway or let the player follow the girl. Pure black hair, extremely white face.- A pain system: 1 hit, just walking normal. 4 hits, struggling. 8 hits, the player is unable to run. This would make the player really want to avoid the zombies. WEAPONS: *- Flamethrower                      -- X26 Taser                           Learn more- X12 Taser                           Learn more- Crossbow                            Learn more- Bow                                     -- Zipline Crossbow                 -- .44 Magnum                        -- Flare Gun                            Learn more- Knuckle-duster                    -- Spring Knife                        -- UZI                                       Learn more- Flashbang Knife                    Learn more- Remote Injection Gun          Learn more- KSG                                      Learn more *Some of the ideas can already be mentioned but it's nice to have all my ideas/suggestions in one post. Note that all the goo.gl urls are going to YouTube.com and no other website. EXTRA:Zombie animals: I didn't gave this a place in my list. I don't think this belongs in this game as it isn't really THAT scary. But don't worry, I will give it a place in my list when Techland can release a example for the animals. I just want to see what they could actually look like!

"816","Particular weapons in state of decay...Just the snubies and the wooden stock bolt rifles...That's it.I'm using the same weapons in The Division when I get a chance.

"817","So this is regarding the crafting system of the game. Im not sure what is actually ""craftable"" in the game. For that matter how many items are in the game pertaining to weapons, tools, and raw components (basic stuff lying around used to craft). I suggest adding a Tier system to the crafting mechanic. Similar to upgrading the characters Strength or Agility, more useful/powerful crafted items can only be obtained after performing certain requirements like crafting X amount of times, or crafting certain things, etc. The Tier is sort of like a skill tree and as you unlock each branch in the Tier it opens up more options to craft more things. Your character starts low and not as knowledgable, so they cant craft much of anything but soon they will be able to craft a wealth of things as you progress. Also it isnt just limited to weapons. You can also craft performance enhancements by finding chemicals, medical supplies, herbs, and suppliments scattered around the towns.","Feature requests",172

"821","Now I've been thinking abt the zoo...A gorilla that's infected, now that's something to be scared of. The intense roar and the pounding of the beast will attract more zombies. I'd be brave to go take a picture of it, but something that scary to get close too...Noooo way! The form of it might change. Now the birds! It'll be easy to kill them. Just say that they are affected by the high intensity of lights, and make them only come out at the dawn of day. Seeming that it sounds like Gears of wars here, make it to where birds will try to attack you. Or make some kind of district area where birds are only at this or that district.

"826","Just saying don't take the absurd and kinda childish suggestions too seriously.If I remember correctly Dead Light is a post apocalyptic zombie horror survival game in concept, scope of enemies should only limit to mainly, ZOMBIES, humans, and probably some unfortunate incidents like car crash or building collapses, adding ""animals"" as zombies, would just change the ""ambiance"" and the experience like I'm just playing this game again, seriously almost all MMORPG have animals to slay, besides it adding zombie animals reminds me of too much of like Resident Evil, Devil May cry, etc like I did this awhile ago. Dying Light should only remind me of itself, and maybe a lil bit of DI.Conclusion: scrap the zombie animal idea, its dope, out-of-scope, comical and uncool, probably you should ask advice from other experienced horror  survival game studiosI think Dead Island would be the game that branded the zombie survival game in a light way thou, but its not too late, lets brand Dying Light THE Zombie Horror Survival Game with great character and weapon customizations, well, I'm out of thoughts to explain, and I have some emails to send, see yah!","Feature requests",181

"835","So I actually said this in my reply to the ""Questions from the Developers to You"" topic about a craftable zombie bile which you could use to attract zombies to certain location for escape or combat purposes. And then thanks to WizarD for posting a video about what seems like a special infected similar to a slimmer Boomer I just got another idea for craftable weapons. What if special infected zombies dropped some item that we could use to craft special tools with. This would add a risk-reward scenario to facing them. You either turn the prey into the predator to try and harvest this item, not even guaranteed they will drop it by trying to fight them or you flee and forget it. Depending on the special zombie it would drop whatever closely matches its characteristics. Ex: the Blood Black Zombie that seems to attract other zombies, kill it and it possibly drops a special organ sac containing the bile inside. Loot it. Then use a beaker to drain some of your health (blood) or kill a human bandit and use the beaker to harvest theirs. Mix that beaker with blood, the special zombie bile sac, some herbs to make a zombie attracting agent.","Feature requests",190

"840","So I'm guessing the outbreak happened in some villa, and based on the gameplay, that's where most of the zombies are, along with some intense item gear to suit up ur character. So I've been thinking and if it's possible to include wearable helmets, go for it. Making the screen fit the helmets view and other wearable materials that would make the game as realistic as it is. Plus I wouldn't mind using my helmet as a last resort weapon when my other things have broken. Now weight is something that's gonna be implemented, so carrying the littlest things will probably be better for you.

"843","Hi, first of all congrats for making this next gen game (Im pretty sure this free movement becomes global on gaming). 1. I wish you could do limited edition case for the pre-order, and i would like to know how i could order it to here, Finland. 2. Is about Crossbows/Bows, i really think we need those in this game the fact that some want to move silently. For example when i played farcry3, i was really glad that there was a bow in that game, gave it another aproach. It also became my main wpn in the game. I think it would be good if the bows ammo would be  10/15. And the arrows could be picked back. This way it wouldnt be so OP, since its already silent. I writed this on Ps4, i hope you can read this, thank you all for this game, cant wait! And Daryl from walking is badass for a reason ","Feature requests",198

"849","Hey guys, I've been reading your ideas and there are some that have caught my attention. For example, infected animals. I think infected dogs scattered around here and there would still keep the horror and Dying Light vibe. It would be insanely fun if I were scavenging a house or apartment and heard a growl coming from another room. Expanding on that idea, what do you think of implementing regular dogs into the game to use? It might detract from the natural movement and exploration of the game. However, maybe using them help out the character like a trap does. How would they be used? Well, either as bait or maybe a command that allows you to whistle to the dog to attack the zombies chasing behind you. Much like running next to a car, activating the trap and blowing up zombies, you could run next to a dog hiding in a house, whistle and it'll attack the zombies chasing behind you. Maybe some dogs will help, or maybe they'll just run away from the chase. Make it a 25% chance that they will help you and a 75% chance that they won't. Or just simply use the dog as bait, however, firecrackers are added to the game so maybe it's not necessary (But if a player is all out this might be helpful. Even though it's a bit evil to use dogs as bait, it would add to the human ""monster"" part of the game. It could be a feature implemented into the skill tree, but far into it. So as Kyle changes it becomes easier for him to make those kinds of decisions.) Thank you for taking the time to read my idea! I really appreciate it.","Feature requests",204

"851","Hello dear Mod/Devs, I am myself a competitive player and when I saw Dying Light the first time about 5 months ago, you blew me away. Thanks for that. I sincerely apologize for any mistakes or some chaos here and there. So my ideas mainly focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game.   Lets jump right into it:  So for Dying Light I got some ideas on how to make it more tactical, smart and competitive.  My ideas just plan on giving long time fun and making an actual skill difference between an beginner and an Dying Light Veteran. Which for me is very important. Since I dont want an beginner to be stronger than a Veteran Player.  1. Some ranking where you can see how ""pro"" your friends are. (But dont make one single ladder where you are for example just the number 280.000, since some number would be the only indicator on your skill) 2. Housing (you have your own hiding, with your weapons, crafting table, etc. ) Doesnt have to be a house, could also be a hole in the earth or in a bush, ... Edit: I read you already implemented an Safe Zone which is even cooler than housing!   3. Sonar Ping - The two edged sword (You already implemented that greatly, in some kind of shockwaves on the ground)  First I wanna say that I love the idea where you can send some kind of ""ping"" to reveal other (especially) the stronger zombies. But I would love to transfer that versus other players.(If you still dont know what I mean, in your 12 min Gameplay you can see it at min ~10:04, these round white/red waves)   3.1 Sonar Ping - What is the Sonar Ping exactly? 3.11 Reveals enemies only in an smaller area through walls for a short time (1second). Also it gives out your own position. Example on why it could be useful: You are alone at night and you think there is an enemy player hunting you, yet you have no idea where he is. So you can use your ping to reveal the hunter/attacker. Which could give you a slight advantage!  Pings do not reveal the enemy player if he stands still or does not move. Example: So if you are skilled you can guess when an hunter (human player) will ping and dont move for that time.If the enemy used his ping you can see that he revealed himself and because of the cooldown you can get away fast or kill the attacker. (The hunter, becomes the hunted)   3.12 Advanced technique: Radar Cancelling  What is Radar Cancelling? When 2 players send out their Ping and those 2 Pings meet, they are cancelled and it wont reveal the others persons location.  They wont show up through walls, giving the false impression that there is no one.  To be good at radar cancelling, you must be very pro and read the other players mind. (Like if the enemy has a habit of pinging every time the ability is available etc.)  Example of successful cancelling: You guess when an enemy will send out his ping and then you send yours when you think the enemy will send it. If you have guessed it right the attacker wont know your location, you as well wont know the enemies location. Now that you cancelled it you have 3 options:  1. Run away from the attacker and get out of range of his Sonar Ping. (Flee if you cant fight)2. Change position smart and fast with your hook (hook is the spiderman gun) and backstab the attacker. (The hunter became the hunted)3. Running straight onto him with your super-modified-ultra-weapon and fire blindly at everything that has a pulse. (Something I dont wish to see in the game)  Other stuff: Also you can use your Sonar to send fake pings to other players, to make them come to you. Pretending you are a noob and then you strike them... (Baiting) Baiting them into making them believe you are vulnerable and that you dont know what to do, and then you got some traps so that you kill the attacker.   3.13 If you think Sonar Ping is too op, then this is the solution: If you dont have an Sonar Ping equipped then you can't get revealed by other players pings or just in an even smaller area for an even shorter time. (Kinda a Noob protection)   4. The grappling hook Cool idea actually. I wonder if there are somewhen players to see jumping around the world, hooking onto roofs and just being uncatchable, simply cause they are too skilled.  5. Air Drops There is regularly flying an airplane by dropping packages with interesting stuff. When there are 2 squads that have to get it, it could make ""get the air drop"" into an really tactical fight about the surrounding area of the airdrop itself and against the smartness of the other team. It could be a 4 vs. 4. Everyone has its own specific role. Like 1 guy is the ""Spotter/Sniper"" having binoculars and keeps telling the team about the enemies movements and the airdrop itself.Then there is one runner and 2 SMGs trying to shut down the enemies SMG's. 6. Crafting  At a really high level you know how to craft fake air drops exploding when someone tries to open them. Or you place an claymore/C4 (explosive) near an existing air dropand wait for an enemyto come by. If the enemy goes near it, he dies, you will have his weapons plus air drop. (Tactical but ... camping) To avoid that you have to scan the surrounding area for someone that has view of the air drop and kill him first to get the air drop.  7. Maybe add Gore Levels (A big maybe) I know you want Gore to turn on and turn off, but what would give more customization is: Gore Levels in the Option menu. Example: Gorelevel 1: No Gore. Gorelvl2: Some Gore. Gorelvl3: Much Gore... etc.  8. ""Being able to cover your character in zombie blood so the ""fellow"" zombies don't recognize you (make sure to include a zombie-walking animation)"" Also good to trick human players... but it should only be possible for a short time 30 secs or so maximum. If you dont wash it off you can get infected... 9. Optional  Like you have something in your hand mustnt be a weapon. I mean do you guys know the Ork Blade in the Lord of the Rings where the Blade shines blue if Orks are nearby? I could imagine a similar feature in Dying Light. (Isnt very useful since there are probably zombies everywhere)  Also I got some ""critics"":  You know that running around, killing zombies and collecting weapons and stuff is really good and nice. But is there a ""higher"" goal? (I would recommend some kind of mod where you fight against another team about an supply drop or something similar.    Also I have to point out: Its hella awesome that we players can kinda create the game with you! Dont know what to say, except thank you!    If you have any questions (Maybe you dont understand the Sonar Ping, I got much more ideas on that... I gladly give more information to that, just first I need to hear some impression)Edited July 20, 2014 by SynticZ","Feature requests",206

"855","Their are a great deal of people who can't afford high speed Internet, and therefore can't play this game online with friends. Even though you guys aren't going to do SPLITSCREEN I think it would be amazing if you added it in. More people wound buy it and plus chilling with your friends in the same room is a whole lot better than doing it online.

Splitscreen is better than playing with a bunch of strangers you don't know online anyways. Since parkour is a huge part of this game I have a few ideas I would like to present: 1. Skateboarding would go hand and hand with parkour I think. Plus who doesn't want to skateboard from building to building.2. I think weather should effect gameplay, for example the streets could get flooded in lying areas and if their is water on the ground youhave a small chance of slipping and being eaten by zombies.3. A sandbox mode/ creative mode where youcan make your own zombie/parkour challenge.4. Bows and crossbows would be nice. Plus they're quiet and good for nighttime stealth.5. Some sort of comical weapon that's just all around funny but really rare.6. Cheat Codes: like a super jump or power punch or invincibility and stuff. 3. Also:7. Medieval Weapons would be cool.8. An Ice Mod attachment on weapons that freezes enemies.9. A fantasy mode where you can use magic on zombies, and like shot fireballs at them and stuff.10. A trap you can make that has four spinning blades on it and chops up zombies.11. A badass heavy metal/ metalcore/ punkrock playlist to listen to when killing zombies. A backpack inventory that is realistic, for example when you open up the inventory you actually look inside the backpack like in the last of us.Also one more thing, in multiplayer you should have an option to lie down and act like you are hurt and then surprise the other player and attack them.A backpack inventory that is realistic, for example when you open up the inventory you actually look inside the backpack like in the last of us.Also one more thing, in multiplayer you should have an option to lie down and act like you are hurt and then surprise the other player and attack them.A backpack inventory that is realistic, for example when you open up the inventory you actually look inside the backpack like in the last of us.Also one more thing, in multiplayer you should have an option to lie down and act like you are hurt and then surprise the other player and attack them.","Feature requests",210

"857","How about crossover content with Hellraid? I recall in a video interview you did with Polygon, there were 2 people who were working on Dying Light leading the crew to another studio off somewhere where some of the Techland team was working primarily on Hellraid, but you had some of your guys there as well just because your project and team was getting so big. It would be a cool little easter egg if you had little rare events/appearances where monsters from Hellraid like the Blinded or Bloodhunter would show up.","Feature requests",212
"858","I would really like to see a horde mode of some kind in this game. I love the big open world thing you've got, but I think would be great if you could breakdown the world into smaller map locations to have a wave/barrier defence game mode.  So zombies come in increasing waves each time, where its a fight but no flight situation.So like Old town would be its own contained map and you have to scavenge weapons and items only in that location and there's barriers stopping you from leaving. It starts in the day you where need to need to gather all you're stuff, then come the night the endless waves come.     Edited July 21, 2014 by Temps","Feature requests",213

"860","I think blood that gets on the player's clothes, the amount of blood is determined by the number of zombies the player has killed. This helps at night as it makes the player slightly harder to detect at longer distances but the have a special infected that is lured to you during the day if you have killed a lot of the normal zombies.","Feature requests",215
"861","If possible, I would like to see more detailed deaths. Only saying this because it would add to the horror element to the game. IE, if you die by a zombie you watch yourself get eaten alive by it. And if there were to be VR support, more detailed deaths would make it feel like you are getting eaten by zombies for real. Now that would make the horror in the game even a little better!","Feature requests",216

"863","SUGGESTIONS: *- Much animation, such as takedown attack animations.- Add unique weapons in the game.- Make it so like it's a free world, go where ever you wanna go, not a one-path straight forward game.- Don't make your team-NPC's lazy. In the beginning a guy is just telling the objective and once he's finished, he's just going to sit in his chair looking at the sunset. Make it so he's checking a radar, doing something, you know.- When you get cash (put cash in the drops), make it so you can buy weapons from it.- Let the player have their own profile in the start-menu. Let the player be able to equip weapons and let them choose his weapons to use for that certain mission from the start-menu.- Missions in buildings when it's dark. I like being scared.- Make the zombies more scarier with more blood.- Make some zombies bigger than the player.- Make some zombies very fast.- I really like the roll animation, do more of that! Very unique.- Make a large kind of various zombie skins. I've seen the demo and I see very often the same zombie walking by but that's just the demo.- Make it so the player goes outside the city, like activating something inside the forests and then going back to the city.- Do something with MMA takedowns. Some of them are really cool to have in this game and to use it on a zombie. You guys can check out this video: .- Brute takedowns. I wanna see some heavy takedowns, like this takedown: .- Weaponwheel. That's a must-have for 2014+ games. It's fast, easy and clear.- If you don't have a weapon or flashlight, you will be given a glowstick in your inventory for when it gets darker. Once used, you have to deal with the darkness without help by a glowstick or flashlight until you find one.- I mentioned before, the custom controls. I really hope this will make its way to Dying Light as this is a great feature to have.- A zoom function to notice zombies in the distance.- In Co-op mode, do not let the players spawn behind eachother. Make it so players have to search for eachother.- PRE-ORDER DLC: Make it so the co-op zombie can climb walls and walk on the ceiling. That would be terrifying!- Ghost girl jumpscares. Let her stand in a doorway or let the player follow the girl. Pure black hair, extremely white face. WEAPONS: *- Flamethrower- X26 Taser- X12 Taser- Crossbow- Bow- Zipline Crossbow- .44 Magnum- Flare Gun- Knuckle-duster- Spring Knife- UZI- Harpoon- Flashbang Knife: Once a zombie is knifed, he won't be able to see anything for 5 seconds. *Some of the ideas can already be mentioned but it's nice to have all my ideas/suggestions in one post. Note that all the goo.gl urls are going to YouTube.com and no other website. EXTRA:Zombie animals: I didn't gave this a place in my list. I don't think this belongs in this game as it isn't really THAT scary. But don't worry, I will give it a place in my list when Techland can release a example for the animals.

Where you can see the feet and all and also as a practitioner, your elbow is never placed when you roll, it's only the shoulder Pop Vault- (skill) On walls you can't exactly vault over, but they are pretty small to climb Basically the player jumps on the wall and sort of wall climbs but they vault over it right when they are hanging Gate vault-(Advanced skill) I don't really know how to explain the move but I'm sure it is somewhere out there on the Internet Tricking OOOHHHH I know it's a big waste of time but this adds more of the bad4$$ (excuse my language) but it does look real cool as you are just in the air and doing a front flip but it does waste your time Ill be thinking about more soon enough as each move comes","Feature requests",221

This can be a door opener to escape, Perhaps?I like the idea of making your own Parkour/ Survival map (Survival-You liked the idea so you might have implemented it?) It will kind of add a type of mirrors edge feel which is probably what your not trying to achieve, but adding more and more parts to the game to make it ever more sweeter wont hurt will it? You can make competitions and stuff for the community of Dying Light.This place, Harran, is a Quarantined area right? Perhaps having a game mode that splits it up as the game progresses with more and more zombies coming in each split area one by one? This is just a rusty idea. But will be intense as the whole island will be swarming with zombies.Eventually.And we would just love a demo that shows a gist of combat and parkour. Please.

"873","I've always thought it would be great in an rpg if when your weapon broke, you were still able to use it in it's broken state, like if you had a axe and you break the handle, well now you have a jagged axe handle to spear zombies with. These broken Items would eventually break themselves, and then you'd really be screwedEdited July 24, 2014 by G-wash","Feature requests",228
"874","I was just thinking ""I hope there are big indoor levels in this game"".  So your based in Harran, but say there is a mansion or chapel or just some giant house located in the game for you to explore in, it doesn't even need to be part of the story, just be there. With what this game offers I think it would be awesome to navigate a zombie filled area that is sort of enclosed, and maneuver around narrow zombie infested corridors and hallways trying to reach place to place. Utilize your parkour in this tight packed spots by wall running, fighting them off, escaping through rooms, just exploring this big indoor area to see what lies inside.","Feature requests",229

Is basically the zombie audio from dead island in dying light with no modifications to it?Are there going to be no new sounds for different zombies?Different sounds for the way they move about and noise levels..

"878","I didn't read all the posts so I don't know if anyone's touched on this already. Fallout used to be my jam, until The Last of Us came out, it answered the question; how would things really be if a zombie outbreak happened? I loved the realism(used loosely) and how fluid the game play was. but it lacked in a multiplayer system wasted on 3 game types, 8 players and small maps with regenerating supply boxes. The itch to have three of my buddies armed to the teeth, and stealthily, simultaneously killing zombies whilst scavenging a mall or town, was left unitched. I try to use minecraft as a substitute but this game has the chance to be soooo good. Campaign is nice but make sure the multiplayer is boundless. We can't run out of adventure if we keep making it for ourselves. Power to the player. Yet I am still very concerned for the health system.First, right off the bat, no crappy first person shooter instant regen. Like Halo or COD. You can get shot up to kingdom come but after a few gusts of heavy breathing your bullet holes seal themselves. Halo gets around it with the energy shield, but lots of games do it.Second, health items just can't instantly heal you from the pause menu. The Last of Us does it right; you have to unequip your gun pull out a health kit and painfully watch as he wraps the bandages around his leg.And last, part of the caution of initiating firefights is that your health is low, from falling or some other skirmish. But it can't stay that way. We all know that our bodies heal, so health bars should too. But in reality you can't just get shot up, go hide in a corner,and emerge ten minutes later fully charged. Skyrim's health bar regeneration time is too fast, (there I said it). So, the in game health bar's got to be so slow that no one would consider waiting out the healing time. But, this is where my idea comes in...... Eating food should increase your health bar's regeneration time. Then foods like candy or donuts or whatever can increase it faster but for a short amount of time, whilst beef or potatoes gives it a long steady increase. So if you don't eat any thing your health stays where it is. Maybe even a low enough food/hunger(whatever) could make your health go down. I mean, we all got to eat right? So, recap,Health bar, yes.Lots of health increase items/level up perks, no.Health regeneration, yes, but soooo sloooow.Food items, yes, but they only increase healing rate(eating 50 hunks of cheese will not close up a stab wound)Edited July 24, 2014 by Prodias","Feature requests",233

"894","Hello everyone. I'd like to post an idea for a Game Mode on here   Let me take this time to explain my game mode idea. Its a singleplayer game mode that only replaces the current protagonist character model and the3 others you play in co-op to Yautja (Predators) with some Predator related visual changes, sounds, audios, and conversation patterns added to them to make the mode feel more authentic, replacing sounds, audios, and conversations the human protagonist uses. I've also added a lists of Predator themed equipment, weapons, abilities, and a list of little graphic changes to make the gameplay feel more like your actually playing as Predators. This doesn't change anything about the storyline in Dying Light. it just adds Predators as a playable option in the gameplay of the main campaign of thegame, you still play-through the storyline but as a Predator, making you feel a more badass but in a more awesome way. I've also added some backgroundstory about the Predators like, Why are they here, what are they planning to do here (in the game). I'll also add some picture and video links forexamples on how Predators behave, communicate, look, and Predator themed equipment, weapons if i can find some. And i'll add some details about the Predators from my own personal  knowledge and to the best of my ability. I hope you guys like my idea and do comment on it and let me know what youguys think of it, hope you guys enjoy it as much as I had thinking it up.  I'll put up some of them as soon as i can (if i can remember where i saved them xD).Edited July 28, 2014 by Deadly_Jack","Feature requests",249
"895","Facts for Dying Light Predator Game Mode, The Predators are able to use all Human Melee and Range weapons, and have teamed up with some of the friendlyhumans of Harran to make survival for themselves and for the friendly humans a little easier. Lol.. For now. The Masks that the Predators are wearing in this game mode do not have the ability to see in the dark, instead they're as blind in the dark as humans are and have to use flashlights as well butthey have modified masks that mimic the ability to do the night-sense-pulse ability that Kyle Crane has.The question of how can the player can get access to all of the Predator Weaponry I've listed. Well since the players play as the Predator, they already have them all but they have to reach a certain level to unlock Predator weaponry for in-game use.  I would like to pitch an idea I read about on the dying light forums towards your way about putting in a progression system for but for weapons in thegame that works for both Predator and Human weaponry (melee and range weaponry). The weapons can progress in the game by being used by the player a set number of times before it level up to add more favorable states on it like higher damage, longer durability, more craftable options on it, and more options to add mods on it (if there are gonna be addable mods for weapons in the game, both range and melee related). I have a personal request for Techland, can you guys put some different museums around Harran for players to explore and loot for maybe some Medieval, World War 1, and World war 2 weaponry melee and range related the same goes for some gun-stores (just not really old ones like in the museums), (put different gun-stores and museumsaround the city of Harran but don't make it easy for the players to unlock the museums and gun-stores for entry, some of these places could even be usedas safe-zones or safe-houses).     Little background story ideas:  1. From the cold dark outer reaches Of our solar system. A ancient race Of aliens have came to our world once again. A small group of Young Yautja Hunters.Ready and eager to prove themselves worthy as effective Killers..., as Warriors. But little do they know of the dangers the Zombie Pandemic and how it willoverwhelm them with horrors they've never experienced before. Take control and play as The Predator.  Experience this new world for yourself and survive itwith only instinct, skill, a strict code of honor, the equipment and weapons they've brought with them from another world, and test yourself. How long can you survive this World!? How long can you survive in Harran!? How long can you survive the Night?..... Good Night Good Luck.    Character model, items, and outlook ideas:  http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Young_Blood  1. For my SinglePlayer Predator Mode, replace the wristwatch on the left wrist on the character model with a metallic Predator style bracelet (Predator/Aliencarving and symbols), it tells time but in classic red/green color indicators/numbers.  2. The Predator are some YoungBlood  Predator character models (insert picture/video link example here).  http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Young_Blood Weapon ideas:                                              (For most of theses weapons you can find on this link and feel free to add anymore if you TechLand guys can)  http://aliens.wikia.com/wiki/Yautja_Weapons  1. Classic Predator The Chakram (smart disc)   (usable as a single-handed melee weapon like in Predator 2 the movie). 2. Classic Predator double-bladed-WriStblades (single-Handed melee weapon).  3. Predator WristBladeSword a single-long-bladed-wrisblade like a demonic looking katana blade attached on his arm like the wristblade weapon (single-Handed melee weapon).  4. Predator CombatStick (Two-handed melee weapon).  5. Predator Shunriken (usable as both throwing knifes and as a single-handed Melee weapon like in AvP the movie).  6. Predator Netgun (usable as a offensive and defensive weapon but mostly usable defensively with the wide-spread-net it fires out, it's collectibleand re-usable after one single shot) its a range weapon about the size of a small handcannon (like in AvP the Movie) and its function is to launcha light-weight metallic net that ensnares and holds anything it catches in one place (Zombies/Virals) for 10 or 15 seconds for you to finish them offor beat down (up against the wall or on the ground or even both if the ground is close to the wall like a building) it works on all common zombies and some special infected.  7. Instead of using fist to fight zombies hand-to-hand when weapons are not equipped, the Predator can use its claws to fight zombies hand-to-hand when he doesn't have any (Predator or Human) weapons equipped (the claws do 10% higher damage then bare fist do in general).  http://aliens.wikia.com/wiki/Yautja_Weapons     Ability ideas:  1. Have a slightly higher jumping ability.  2. The night sense Pulse ability can be explained as a new Predator tech on their masks for this mode.  3. In co-op mode and in single player mode, give the Predator the ability to do a loud (Predator Rawer) to distract zombies from co-op buddies who are with you and give them a chance to run or do something in peace while the infected are attracted to you, or just to attract the infected to you to fight them yourself, or that you can quickly dispose of them with traps if you're near some, or even use the (Predator Rawer ability) to tell yourco-op buddies where you are on the map only if your near them (at your own risk).  4. The ability to do like a (stab the wall with Predator style climbing knife or knifes to hurl or push your self up to reach for a climbable surfaceor ledge) ability where you're able to reach a spot where you weren't able to before.  5. The ability to do the 360 turn attack like the electric-axe but with the Predator WristBladeSword that looks like a demonic katana blade weapon thats attached to the Predator's arm like the WristBlade weapon.  6. The ability to jump off a zombie but within seconds, turn around in Mid-Air while running full-speed and doing a Mid-Air 360 Round-House-Kick, or a 360  mid-air turn slash from the Predator's WristBladeSword at the zombies that are chasing you.  (These next ones are gore-filled finishing moves)  7. The ability to just simply just bash a zombie's head into the wall repeatedly (once or twice) until its dead with its brains splattered all over the wall when your close enough to one.  8. The ability to twist off a zombie's head quickly from its spine and toss it aside, or on the ground close to the zombie's body and just smashingit with brute force with the Predator's foot.  9. The ability to thrust the Predator's hand into a zombie from behind and just simply ripping off its spine with the head still attached to it andsmashing it again't a nearby wall or ground.  10. While running full-speed at a zombie the Predator has the ability to quickly rip off the zombie's head seconds before he jump off it's shoulders.  11. The ability to collect a set number of zombie heads, or skulls and store them in the inventory to be used as throwableprojectiles.  12. The ability to utilize a zombie's spine with it's head, or skull still attached to it as a blunt melee weapon like a baseball bat (the Predator can use one spine weapon at a time till its useless, or till the Predator can get another one and it can be kepted in the Predator'sinventory till its used in gameplay and its customizable).  13. The ability to create makeshift weapons on the spot out of other weapons that are about to be UN-usable from excessive usage (both Human and Predatorrelated a few, or more melee and range weapons in Dying Light).  14.The ability to do a finishing move on a zombie from behind with the WristBladeSword (the Predator chops a zombie's head off from behind when he crouches which is also good for night-time silent take-downs).  15. The ability to simply use the Predator's brute force to grab a zombie, or a human like a ragdoll and toss it with intense force it at any direction(hopefully at a group of zombies or hostile humans).  16.The ability to run up a wall while running at full speed and do a back-flip, landing behind the zombie that's chasing you doing another back-flip (a sort of backflip kick) but close up to the zombie, sending it flying (maybe at a wall if your near one).  17. The ability to launch the sword blade from the WristBladeSword at a zombie, impaling it against a wall (after impaling the zombie against the wall,another sword blade comes out of the WristBladeSword, and you can use that to finish off the zombie that you impaled, in the usual melee style, kill it and the sword blade you launched before, can be taken back and re-used after for the same thing again).The ability to do a finishing move a zombieby lowering the Predator's arm down, retracting the sword blade on his WristBladeSword and raising the arm back up, releasing the sword blade back outfast when the zombie is close, slicing it in half (Sort of a uppercut-slash attack).    Predator sounds and audio replacements for some movements, actions, and conversations:  http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Yautja_language?file=31445_10151763069436605_248703632_n.jpg 1. Predator audio and sound for movements and actions like when the Predator stops and breaths heavily from  being tired performing parkour moves, combosand running long distances.  2. Sounds and audios for Jumping, taking hits, using healing items or any medication, using an item, after finishing crafting an item or weapon, before andafter doing a finishing move, landing from a high jump from running full speed, a very little on climbing. When taking damage.  3. When sometimes the protagonist would say something or make comments when he manages to make loud sounds in a critical situation like before and after shooting a explosive barrel or (exploding hazmat zombies or suiesider zombies or any exploding zombies in general).  4. When hes being chased intensely at night by Volitoles or fast moving Virals in daytime.  5. When he spots a Special infected and and says something in reaction of seeing it but only sometimes.  6. When he sees something in casual situations that makes him react and say something or even in scripted situations.  7. In Cutscenes The Predator can say a few or more things in human language to communicate with Humans in general and even use hands and body language toexpress what he's trying to say (like at some scenes when the girl asks him to help her and not leave her alone and the ending scene of First AvP themovie).  8. When Jade talks to the Predator on the radio, he responses back to her but in few predator style spoken words (This one is optional so if you guys don't want to do the radio back and forth talking thing well that's just fine with me lol it can be one sided with Jade only giving you information on anything  and you only responses in a few Predator sounding grunts).  9. Predator audio and sound for movements and actions When the Predator sees Bandits and reacts with imitating or angry Predator sounds but only sometimes,When the  Predator interacts with objects like Gates and Power switches, When the Predator establishes a safe-zone http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Yautja_language?file=31445_10151763069436605_248703632_n.jpg   Useful throw-able item ideas:  1. Small (Orbs) that the Predator can throw or launch at zombies (if you hold the trigger long enough) or on the ground/wall/cielling and as soon at it comes into contact with the ground/wall/cielling it starts lighting up a semi large area like a small round green flare, its an item that can be used as a tool to  and as well as a offensive weapon, its see in the dark and attract zombies even to set them on (Multi-colored yellow/orange-ish) fire if youthrow/launch at one, its good to use for 1 minute and 20 seconds and its usable in both day and night, its able to stick on any surface like a sticky grenade.  2. Using many severed zombie heads as projectiles (like throwing knifes) at other zombies, hostile humans, exploding zombies, and exploding barrels(the Predator can keep zombie heads in its inventory until it uses it as projectiles in the gameplay).  3. A Predator themed grenade that when the Predator throws at a group of zombies, it launches mini grappling hooks that are attached on mini wire like armsaround the zombies and it basically pulls them close together and then within seconds, slices them up into little pieces or pulls them close together and within seconds, the grenade explodes killing the zombies that it pulled in with it, this grenade has two functions that can be switched between slicingzombies up or blowing them away and the player can choose between these functions by switching its ability in the inventory menu (The player only has about 10 of these grenades to use for this mode).      Little Graphic changes:            (Some of these major examples can be found on Google images, Avp the Game WalkThrough and some I imagined) 1. The Predator bleeds out slightly glowing green blood whenever he is attacked like the original game character of dying light (slightly glowing green blood like in the AvP Movies/Games).  2. Change the Crosshair white dot too 3 triangle red dots without the lines (the lines can show up as you're aiming on a solid surface that is grapplinghook friendly etc).  3.When you do the (Predator Rawer ability) to distract zombies, it does it's classic pose when it rawrs (only visible in co-op by others).  4. change the grappling hook on the right hand to look as if the Predator is shooting out or throwing out a sort of chained wire with a Predator style looking hook.  5. At night time the Predators have glowing green or white eyes from their masks which is only visible to others in co-op as you can see their Predator characters with glowing green  or white eyes like yourself.  6. Predators can use the control-pad on WristGauntlet on their right arm to activate traps (when they're close enough to them).    i do recommend you guys to click on the http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Yautja_language?file=31445_10151763069436605_248703632_n.jpg  link, its actually impressiveEdited July 29, 2014 by Deadly_Jack","Feature requests",250

"905","In the meantime here is the rest of my idea for the game mode, i still feel it can be done. (one can hope)    Predator game mode related new facts and suggestions: 1. In this game mode, the Predators do not have cloaking abilities, they just have the stealth/sneaking abilities the main protagonist in the game has. 2. This is my version of supply crates/boxes and how the people playing as Predators in Dying Light (if the idea is approved) can get them, with and without quest markers (if the player knows where to look) for this Predator game mode.  If there are gonna museums in the game, then some of them have may have giant vaults where ancient unidentified artifacts are stored, and maybe when youas the Predator go into these vaults and happen to find some of these unidentified artifacts, you're able to identify them because they're ancient Yautjaartifact boxes, containing both old and new Yautja tech like tech scrap, tech parts, weapon parts (disassembled), equipment parts (disassembled as well), Yautja Food rashins, medication, weapon mods (common ones, rare ones, are hard to find and usable on human weapons too), and this is all in one box, and a beacon device that tells you of other different boxes located around Harran's museum's underground giant vaults and give you a quest to get them, and someyou can get without the quest  or quest markers. In the other ancient Yautja artifact box where you found the first box with all the goodies and the beacon in it, there are some of the weapons that the Predator player already have, but in different versions, designs, and levels. These are actually Ancient Yautjasupply boxes found from some ancient pyramids (Mayan, Eygeption) and brought to Harran for safe-keeping before the zombie-outbreak. These boxes were broughtwith ancient keys with them, that were mistaken for human made carving tools, they're actually Yautja keys to those boxes and are on display somewhere in the museum and you as the Predator have to find them only if you want the epic goodies inside. The keys are somewhere in the first and sub-levels of the museumbut it wouldn't be so easy to find them cause the entire place (except some of the vaults) are filled with common, viral, and a few special infected, it justadds to the challenge and its very difficult but, the reward is oh-just-so-tempting!, so good luck getting them, cause you're gonna need all of it. (Lol) 3. This game mode might make you unstoppable, but in fact your not, it just add cool Yautja themed gameplay, so be careful in day-time and as well at night-time, because your just as vulnerable as humans are in this world.  4. Rodents can be found in the severs or the underground (i hope). 5. The potato launcher blueprint can be found in a museum on display  with the description on its case saying (The most dangerous salad tossing weapon alive.) (added as a pun by the museum owners before the zombie outbreak). 6. The Sawed-off-Double-Barrel Shotgun with the writings carved on it with its unusual design (Evil Dead: The Army Of Darkness. Possible Easter Egg) is displayedin a glass case with two Machetes hanging off it from both sides like a cross with 6 packs of quarters around the weapon (Possible Resident Evil: Afterlife Easter Egg). Its in the same museum where the potato launcher blueprint is located. 7. The Tommy Gun can be found in a Police station's evidence lockup room, far back in the room in very old containers, still in prime condition for use (some ammobarrels can be found in a seperate evidence containers and a possible old school gangster Easter egg ) 8. The blueprint for the Pipe Shotgun can be located in the sewers (inside a nuclear fallout shelter/bomb-shelter in the sewers, Possible Metro Last Light Easter egg). this weapon is fully customizable. 9. A sheathed katana next to a big glass case full of severed zombies (possible The Walking Dead Easter egg)  Predator game mode related weapon customization and crafting suggestions: 1. The wall spike-wire-trap can be customized have electric element to it. 2. The Potato Launcher can be customized with a torch being added to it at the end of the barrel, adding a flaming element to its projectiles.  3. The Drones can be equipped with and explosive collar that can be used by remote detonation (WristGauntlet).   Predator game mode related new ability, skill ideas and suggestions: 1. The ability to launch a grappling hook at a zombie and with brute force, swing it around the group of zombies that are attacking you, sending them flying back (like the E3 Demo where the player can do a 360 turn attack the the electric axe). 2. The ability to re-acquire the Small (Orbs) flare grenades by resting and them re-appearing in your inventory. 3. The ability to revive a mortally wounded Predator (co-op predator buddy) by stabbing him/her with classic healing knifes. 4. The ability to heal your self by stabbing your self with Yautja healing knifes that the Predator takes out of his WristGauntlet (this ability only lets youheal 15% of your health and has a recharging time period of 10 minutes before it can be used again and it can only be used 10 times in-game then after that if you  want to use this ability again then you have to goto a safe-house and rest when its required of you and then and only then you can use this ability 10 times again).  5. The ability to catch a small starving rodent and equip it with a small explosive and loud audio device (the loud audio device plays the song RUN BOY RUN. THIS WORLD IS NOT MEAN't FOR YOU. RUN BOY RUN! THEY'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE YOU!! then after that last lyric the rodent goes boom lol) and release it in a largegroup of zombies and it will goto them cause its starving and it smells rotting meat everywhere so its gonna go to the closest source of it and the zombies will be attracted to the loud music then.........KABOOOOM, then i suggest player run like hell to higher ground (Buildings and rooftops). (xD) This abilitycan be used as many times as the player wants (if they can find and catch rodents cause they're really hard to find). This ability is usable in day and nighttimes but i suggest using at night time when the Volitoles come out and releasing this little bundle of explosive joy at a Volitole then find a REALLY REALLYgood place to hide and then.....KAABOOOM!!!. (Lol) After releasing the explosive rodent, the player have about 10 to either run, hide or both till it goes upin an explosive Happy-Zombie/Volitole-Killing Goodness.  6. The ability to use a genetically modified Xenomorph facehugger (Or Two facehuggers) on hostile humans when they're are weakened enough by thePredator in combat (this ability allows the Predator to use a Xenomorph-Drone as a personal attack dog that does extra things for you till its killed in battle,things like attacking targets you tell it to attack, going into small spaces and retrieving items, opening closed doors that you normally wouldn't be able toopen, breaking locks with its special bite attack, luring zombies away from you when you tell it to, silently finishing off zombies in the night time, its undetectable in night time so it can be your best friend at night if you know how to use it properly, distracting virals, zombies special infected from theplayer by doing its Xenomorph style howl at day or night time, it can do a little recon for you and tell you about where somethings are like a supply box, enemies, and obstacles). This Xenomorph Drone is genetically modified, so it will only listen to the Predator it was created from and it will battle along side the Predator until its killed in battle or until the Predator dies and this ability is only good for once a day till the Predator can use it again the nextday so use it wisely and its a little hard to kill since its a Xenomorph Drone so it can take a lot of hits for a long time till its killed and used again thenext day. If the Predator is done using his Xenomorph Drone, he will give them the command to come to him and he can store them away in his inventory and if he want to use them again without using the facehugger ability, he just throws them out like a giant dark ball and they forms out into drones again. The Predator can only use the Facehugger ability twice in one day and won't be able to use this ability again until both Xenomorph Drones are dead and until itsthe next day. The Predator player can only and only use two Xenomorph Drones, and this will not change, ever!. (Lol) This ability would come in handy when playing solo and your just simply too outnumbered, outmatched, and want some assistance. 7. The ability to command your two Xenomorph Drones by aiming at objects (like to open locked doors, locked supply boxes, to collect a killed humans weapon etc),aiming at enemies (like zombies, virals, special infected, bandits/hostile humans), aiming at spots that the Xenomorph Drones can hide in or under (likeopen/closed manholes, under open/closed windows of basements of buildings, in  dark shaded spots, the shadows of some areas, under garbage bags, dumbsters, allthe same places but at night-time, inside dark buildings through open/closed windows, and coming out to attack from all of these areas when commanded too), aiming at enemies then an option shows up to lure zombies, hostile humans away from the Predator player (by making scratching noises, howling in Xenomorph stylehowls, banging at objects, dragging enemies away inside and under buildings killing zombies, virals, special infected, and scaring hostile humans away from theplayer), aiming at an object then an option shows up to make it accessible for the player to climb on (like ladders, bring and stack other objects on top of eachother for the player to jump/climb on to reach another climbable area etc). This ability also lets you command your Drones to stay close to you and they attack anyone that attacks you like zombies, humans but, they do not attack friendly humans etc. When the Predator player aims at one of his Xenomoroh Dronean option shows up to use either one or both of the Drones get stack on each other to make a stepping pad for the player to reach his climbable surface. When the Predator player aims at one of the Xenomorph Drones another option shows up, this option is the level up menu for the Drones to make them stronger and evolve them to something much better, each evolution the Xenomorph Drone goes through, opens more options for abilities for that form and they change form rather for this game mode, they change form by going into  or under a dark area to change form then come back out as something new looking in their Xenomorphforms. The player can do this one drone at a time, like he can have one evolved Xenomorph and the other one still a Xenomporph Drone. When a Xenomorph Droneis killed in battle, it sometimes but only sometimes explodes in a messy acid blood spraying cloud of yellow mist that partly melts its attackers away screaming in agony (zombies, virlals, and hostile humans alike).  8. The ability to use common zombies as Meat-Shields when your gunless and facing hostile humans with guns in a gun/fire fight or when the player does have a gun, he uses the meat-shield ability and uses his gun but sticks it through the zombies torso and fires away till he can find better cover or just run away. 9. The ability to launch a secondary a light-weight-metallic-net from the Predator's WristGauntlet to ensnare zombies/virals in one place for 10 to 15 seconds (this ability can be used over and over and takes five minuts to recharge and be used again in combat or to make a quick escape). 10. The ability to use the combat stick (CombatSpear) to throw as spear at a enemy, impaling it to the wall till its killed and the spear is retrieved. 11. The ability launch the Predator's WristBlades as projectiles at zombies, hostile humans (those blade can be collected back to be used again as projectiles). 12. The ability to do a finishing move on a zombie from behind by using a heavy-duty metallic wire choker (Like Agent 47 in the hitman game series),pulling back the wire so hard that the zombie head just comes straight off (this ability is handy in night-time takedowns on zombies as this make itimpossible for the zombie to make a loud sound or make any sound at all and this ability is usable in both day and night times).  13. The ability to use a heavy duty metallic wire as hanging trap on zombies (when zombies get close to this trap, they get hanged by the neck and pull thewire in a certain way then the wire squeezes around the neck and the head comes straight off, or just leave the zombies hanging there (maybe leave them hanging up-side-down this time) for bandits/hostile humans as traps for them, a little undead present from above for them), just leaving hanging zombies ina previously established safe-zone can be used to scare off hostile humans from that zone, leaving it a safe-zone for the player and their group of human survivors (the hanging up-side-down zombies do not have to be alive when scaring off hostile humans/bandits from a safe-zone).    Predator game mode progression system ideas and suggestions: 1. Earlier I suggested a progression system but for weapons and now I'l like to suggest including the Xenomorph Drones into this system listed as Weaponsand level up as weapons would in it, using the same method i suggested on how weapons would level up in the game, but with the Xenomorph Drones, they just unlock different attacks, abilities,  options for the Predator player like how much hit points/attack damage should the Xenomorph Drone have, more commandoptions for the Predator player that's using them more command options like if to attack or not, to hide ot not, and to do anything else ingeneral or not automaticly or not without the Predator player telling them to or not),  options on how should they be more stealthy, and maybe even evolve them to look moremenessing (how they should look) or to evolve them into another Xenomorph form by injecting them with DNA (these are the options for DNA injection and can beone at a time till its done evolving: Human, Predator, common-zombie, Viral, and special infecteds). These won't make the Xenomorph less obedient to you, its avery carefully modified Xenomorph so it will listen to you regardless of it's evolution and will still play the same role as a Personal attack dog just more fun and forcefully evolved to serve you better in gameplay and it wouldn't make them super powerful, just a tiny bit slightly more powerful from evolution to evolution and they evolve very fast (change form for this game mode). The Xenomorph Drones can progress by killing zombies and being deployed for usage in otherthings like opening doors, successfully luring zombies away from the player, listening to the Predator player's commands, and attacking.     Predator game mode useful throw-able item ideas and suggestions: 1. The Predator is able to keep 5 caught rodents in its inventory for later use for a ability in-game for this game mode. 2. A tennis ball wrapped in duct-tape then has fireworks tied to it and its used as a bouncing decoy that zombies, viral, and special infected follow away fromyou as soon as you throw it away. 3. The Predator can only store up to two Xenomorph Drones in its inventory then deploy (use) them later on at anytime, indoors, outdoors, till there dead. 4. the Predator has a sound device that releases a special call that attracts the Xenomorph Drones (only the Drones can hear this call sound) and the Predator can throw it on the ground to summon back his Xenomorph Drones to him if there too far away or if there not coming to you fast enough.  Predator game mode new weapons ideas and suggestions: 1. A sort of trap weapons that looks like a hand-held Predator style looking spike that the Predator sticks to a wall by stabbing into it and when a group ofCommon angered night zombies are chasing him, the Predator activates that spike (remotely from his WristGauntlet) shoots out from the other end of the spikeat another near by wall, making like a trip wire but its placed higher so when the Predator activates it, it acts as a wire trap and the zombies are too stupid to see it and run into it, having their heads cut straight off their necks and after its safe, the Predator can take back the spike-wire-trap he placedearlier in daytime and it can be used again (the player has 2 of these spike-wire-traps to use only, they can be collected after use, and are customizable).   (Now some of these new weapons suggestions i'm about to write down are not Predator themed but Predators can use them as well and there just for fun).  2. A high-powered potato launcher that not only shoots potatos, it also shoots golf-balls, rocks, silverware like forks, spoons, knifes, tennis balls andpacks of quaters, its capable of shooting at close, medium, and long ranges (its highly customizable and it can be made from almost any range weapon and its usable by both Humans and Predators).  3. A sawed-off-double-barrel shotgun that has carvings written on it ""Hail To The King Baby.. Hail To The King...., Now..  EAT MA BOOMSTICK!!"" (Possible Evil Dead The Army of Darkness Easter Egg) and it doesn't just shoot shotgun shells, it also shoots packs of Quarters for awesome looking (Maximum) damage (Possible Resident Evil: Afterlife reference).  4. A semi automatic paint-ball gun with a extra large paint-ball barrel (the gun is made from metal, not some cheap plastic). 5. A Tommy Gun with not just machine gun bullets, but metal, plastic pallets ad bullets as well (this weapons is customizable as well). 6. A makeshift shotgun made out of a solid drain pipe (Pipe shotgun) 7. A penetrating boltgun (used in putting down animals before the zombie pandemic, now used for putting down zombies after the zombie pandemic). 8. The crossbow weapon (that uses super heated construction rods, when in the crossbow and uses the same construction rods as ammunition, they can be foundat old building ruins or construction sites).                                                                                  (Now back to Predator themed weapons).  7. A Predator style combat/hunting knife to use in hand to hand combat 8. The Predator has a shoulder-cannon that fires a light plasma bolt that does the amount of damage the baseball bat does (its customizable)This weapon can do more damage but later on as its used more and more (weapon progression system). This weapons fires an unlimited amount of bolts butthe cannon overheats so it needs time to recharge (about a minute), after firing 10 shots continuously, it overheats. the weapon can be selected for usefrom where the decoy menu is and you press the decoy throwing trigger to fire the bolts before the icon for the weapon turns a bright red, telling the playerits overheated and needs 30 seconds to be used again (this weapon does not give player full auto-targeting, it gives them a tiny bit of help like how the the player looks at a surface when the grappling hook is selected, through his cross-hair it has a slight auto locking system, telling the player that he canuse the grappling hook there, that's the slight auto-locking aim the shoulder-cannon has).  9. The Predator has a arm-blade he can use as a sword in combat (this weapon can be used while attached to the Predator player arm and its detachable to beused as a sword).       Predator game mode new little graphic changes suggestion list: 1. Show the rodent when the predator has caught it and equipped it with the explosive device then released it to do the players bidding. 2. Show the predator stabbing the wall with the spike (spike-wire-trap).   Predator game mode new Predator related sounds, audio, suggestion list: 1. When the Predator stabs himself with the Yautja healing knifes, he makes a semi loud grunting pain Predator style sound.Edited July 30, 2014 by Deadly_Jack","Feature requests",260

"907","Also tell me, what you folks think about a progression system for weapons?  Man it be just something.. just something to have Vass (Character from FarCry 3) in this game, maybe as playable character or as a Boss, or just as someone who is with you influencing you, talking to you in your head driving you crazy and guiding you (maybe as a ghost Lol) That be fun.Edited July 31, 2014 by Bartosz Buczeluk","Feature requests",262

Anyway, I think you might know this but there is a be the zombie DLC implemented to the game if you pre-order it. It makes sense if you want this idea as an alternate option rather than pre-ordering. I would definitely get this DLC if this is approved as it seems as you've put a lot of effort and thought into it even though the idea being a little 'borrowed'. Maybe Techland could change the idea a little and could become unique to the genre as you get a different vibe to the game (Hunter vs. Hunter), but not too much that it goes a bit over the top, in my opinion Saints Row 4 went crazy over the aliens idea but I guess it is a chaotic game, this DLC WILL change the way people play as you chase an enemy that has the same abilities as you it will be a very tense 'gamemode' shall I say and can be altered a lot as the idea seems very versatile. Versatile enough to possibly add online to this 2 vs 2, 4 vs 4? Possibly. I just want to say its people like you that make everyone happy to know that some people go to great depths to get a very detailed ,in your perspective, idea to Techland and its very interesting to read.

I hope your idea is approved Thumbs crossed. Peace I know what ya talking about but, i own saints row 4, and i do want this idea to be approved, but as far as aliens go in dying light, this is all i was aiming for, but i see ya point and  my second hope for TechLand take a look at it and like kinda improve on it where i (went a tad overboard with some of the list), lol Btw what did ya like about my idea, and what didn't ya like about it?   Meaning from the List of abilities and weapons, both Human and Predator related?  And This idea is a DLC idea, i wasnt expecting to see it out soon, just something they might be able to do if its approved P.S. I've already Pre-Ordered Dying Light and The idea for Hunter vs. Hunter also came from the Pre-order DlC they have for the game already Just hope its done as a Later DLC xDEdited July 31, 2014 by Deadly_Jack","Feature requests",267

'Potato launcher' if it has the same power as a 50.cal bullet count me in lol. The weapons seem very unique. The traps as well, the spike trap set by the predators to trap the zombies is really really cool. TBH this whole idea could be used to make whole new game if tweaked by experts to make it visibly unique. The other chunks of material I have not read through. I will have to save a morning for that much reading. Again I LOVE this idea. Keep hoping they approve. PS: They hasn't been much official replies for any topic so it must mean they are working on the game for the previous idea they approved.

"915","Its nice that someone read my feedback. Anyway, I think you might know this but there is a be the zombie DLC implemented to the game if you pre-order it. It makes sense if you want this idea as an alternate option rather than pre-ordering. I would definitely get this DLC if this is approved as it seems as you've put a lot of effort and thought into it even though the idea being a little 'borrowed'. Maybe Techland could change the idea a little and could become unique to the genre as you get a different vibe to the game (Hunter vs. Hunter), but not too much that it goes a bit over the top, in my opinion Saints Row 4 went crazy over the aliens idea but I guess it is a chaotic game, this DLC WILL change the way people play as you chase an enemy that has the same abilities as you it will be a very tense 'gamemode' shall I say and can be altered a lot as the idea seems very versatile.

Kind of like a last resort.Swinging the grapple hook 360 degrees around a group of zombie- I can see this idea as being very fun.","Feature requests",271

"925","Alright folks, here's my new list of ideas and suggestions for human weapons and abilities, Hope ya enjoy it and like last time, feel free to comment on themand tell me what you all think of them, all the feedback i get from you guys, helps me on my other ideas for the game, and now, enjoy. Lol. My Dying Light Easter Egg weapons and facts involving them, suggestions and ideas list: 1. The (Freddy Krueger) themed melee weapon can be found over a dead child-zombie's head. In a urban houseold, when the player goes upstairs in a childs play-room, a whisper says to the player (make.. th..em rememb..e.r..) (Only on nights in the game when the moon is out, the weapon appears on the dead child-zombie's head) the dead child-zombie lies motionless in the center of the room and after the player grabs the weapon, lightning flashes twice outside of the window of that room and the lights go out, for some seconds and then comesback on with a large creepy bloody writing slowly appearing on the wall ahead of the player that reads with a Freddy Krueger themed voice saying loudly (Heeeere's.... FREDDY!!) followed by a loud classic horror maniacal laughter as the player runs for the exist scared and emotionally freaked out. (It's a in-game Easter Egg for Dying Light) Lol Hope ya like it. 2.The (Sleepy Hollow) themed weapons can be found in a public park area. At the far north-west end of a park near a small cliff and a smallforest of 26 trees, there is a old statue of a Horsemen from the turn of the century covered in vegetation, but (only) on some misty nights where random lightning strikes behind the old statue without a cloud in the sky in the park. The vegetation on and around the statue disappears, revealing a small patch of pumpkins near the base of the statue with some candles lit all around the base into a odd star pattern. When the playerventures to explore this location on these special misty nights in the far north-west end of this park, he/she will see a bright wavy glow of candles comming from the small forest and might go in to see what it is and he/she might find this old statue of a horsemen from the turn of the century. When the player gets closer to the statue, he/she will see bodies of some zombies and bandits layed around near the base of the statuewith their heads missing, when the player looks near the base of the statue, he/she will find the Axe weapon (the weapon of the headless horsemenwho is Death, one of The Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse in The TV Show: Sleepy Hollow) splaced on one of the pumpkins near the base of the statueand the Sword weapon (the weapon of the headless horsemen on his grave site, next to the Withering Willow Tree from the Movie: Sleepy Hollow) isthrough the small forest of 26 trees near the cliff, the Sword is stuck on a tree and right below the placed sword, there is a body of a headlessbandit with a pumpkin next to the body with its hand resting on it. When the player has collected both of the Axe and Sword weapon from the statue location and start to leave the park, there is a loud sound following them now from the small forest, it's the sound of a horse running behind youfollowed with the sound of a sword unsheathing with the running sound coming from behind you, just louder and faster as you run for your life, forthe park exist and as you almost reach the exist, the running sound is upon you, followed with the sound of a slash of the sword with a blood curdlingscreams of a man running, just before the moment his head has been cut straight off his shoulders. The player has reached the park exist and he/shejust might look back for the sounds behind her/him and see a pumpkin-head with a face of terror carved straight into it, laying on the ground just reaching the outside of the park exist. As the player sees the pumpkin head carving, he/she might go back to that statue location to explore again that very moment and if the player counts the bodies of the zombies and the bandits at the statue location, he/she might find the same amount of pumpkin heads next to the base of the statue (with faces of someone running away in utter terror from something carved in to them), the player mightalso find the positions of the bodies eerie, as if they were running away, running towards the direction park exist, this will give a real cold chilldown his/her spine and they might think back to the sounds of the horse and it running after the player followed with the sound of a sword unsheathedand the screams of a man running in the same direction of the park exist as the player did. And Lastly if the player would look at the statue of thehorsemen from the turn of the century, he/she will notice something shocking, the statue's head is missing, replaced with a head of a pumpkin lookingdown at the player motionless with a face of someone with a creepy smile with eyes glaring at him/her, carved into it with a candle lit inside of it,also the player will find candles lit inside of the pumpkins with faces of someone in terror, looking at him/her with a motionless stare near the baseof the headless statue, and then after the player just runs like hell, scared and emotionally freaked out. (It's a in-game Easter Egg for Dying Lightand the Sleepy Hollow themed weapon only appears at misty nights in the public park area but rarely). Hope you all like this one as well.

"939","I was a huge fan of the Dead Island games and I loved a lot of things in those games. I wouldn't mind seeing customization for guns such as scopes and silencers, I think a crossbow or a bow and arrows would be a nice element to the game as well, utilizing the silence factor of the game especially at night. And the missions in the Dead Island Riptide where you and your group fortify and defend a position would be a nice mission or mode in Dying Light, like fortify and start off surviving through the day and then it'll become night soon and just see how many days your group can survive. Thank you much I can't wait to play this game and I hope my ideas help! ","Feature requests",294

"952","Got my password back after sever...many attempts to put in memorable passwords that came to mind. The new coop trailer an double barrel shotgun looks great. I mean it blew my mind a new one. I've about watch the trailer many times, and I'm like yeah! Nowhere is safe to just sit an wait for the night to be over. The safe house is the only capable thing of keeping you safe...for now. This really convinced me to nvr stay out late in this gaming world. I mean it's gonna be a huge scary thing if you do. Endless runners coming outta nowhere, while your options are thin as it is to escape. I love what's been added to the game. The wooden stock rifle such as the double barrel, is the cherry on top. Given that it's a 2 shot weapon, an easy to reload; this is gonna be my choice of weapon if I see any more survival guns such as the revolvers an different rifles.","Feature requests",307

And I'm still wanting zombified animals. A dog chasing you and you have to maneuver around keeps playing back in my head. Anyways.

Even those are rpg games so the gender doesnt there should still be a way of changing it. Look at the game sir you are being hunted. It has a setting which allows you to be a female character and the name on the title screen changes to madam you are being hunted. I dont understand how people can be biased towards females.

Also i dont mind the grapling hook, i actually love the idea of it even if it isnt realistic but c'mon its a zombie game it isn supose to be a simulator or realistic (at least for the zombie part). but this is just my opinion and you all have your and i respec them.

"969","As long as the story and the game in general runs smoothly im happy. I dont mind not being able to play as a woman or a man since its a FPS game plus they made up for it with character customisation and most games anyway you cant choose ( of course games that you can choose give a little bit more realism). Also i dont mind the grapling hook, i actually love the idea of it even if it isnt realistic but c'mon its a zombie game it isn supose to be a simulator or realistic (at least for the zombie part). but this is just my opinion and you all have your and i respec them. Also if any of you preordered the game or will buy it for ps3 i would love if you can give me your gamer tag to play it together when it comes out . my gamer tag is TheSpike97 if you want to add me  Realism isn't really my issue though.

"986","Yeah you are right, the player deserves to at least know he was invaded, but it also should be creative, like lets say an unusual scream that stands out on the distance, or a friend calling you on the radio to report unusual activity in your vecinity, something that keeps the suspense of a hunter lurking around. But still the objective thing should be replaced with something that is more part of what is happening, for example the hunter kills you and the player who was the hunter gets a random blueprint for a weapon/mod , but if the other player gets to a safezone, the hunter cannot get close because of the use of uv lights/heavy weaponry/defenses in general, and the surviving player gets the random blueprint/mod.","Feature requests",341

"991","That's the biggest thing that upsetted me in dead rising 2 the same characters in multiplayer. It's really not very appealing to be looking at different ""you's"" in different costumes.

And on a completely different note. Just though of this actually while looking at my idevice. I'm hoping you guys are still adding music. Well why not just have to where your character has a iPhone. So important characters can contact you, could have a map, maybe a social network for standard survivors that need help, side missions, and of course music. Important characters could also text you coordinates for your map or take a picture of a building and send it to you saying you need to go here. Just a little thing I kinda liked lol.

"996","Dying Light > Improvements I am posting here after a bloke on steam told me I should come here to support PC gamers who want a better quality game. This game looks promising as far as moving 'away' from the Dead Island series (Lets face it, it had pretty awful reviews). I love the idea of Infected becoming a real threat at night, implementation of sneaking is great too. Smooth running/jumping/climbing movement is another plus. A few things still really bother me (I don't think I'm the only one).I would love to see Dying Light move right away from the mechanics/crafting system/ other ideas that Dead Island had, I honestly hated the crafting system within that game, make bullets out of bleach and metal scrap? use wires and a battery and your have an electric blade or gun!? Seriously?! Here's what I would love to see:1: A more believable crafting/mod system. e.g. Craft ammunition out of, box of:Primers, gun powder, projectiles, shells (Not bleach and scrap metal for god sake). Also guys how about no modding of melee weapons, rather than modding it should really be upkeep! how about repair and replacement of dull blades, a new handle even.  Seriously, electric wrenches, burning baseball bats and electro shocking guns are just silly and should only be in children's games. If you want people to feel more powerful with melee weapons than you should be creating skills that allow you to utilize them better, drop the silly mods. For guns, allow the crafting or selling of hollow point bullets, ballistic tip bullets (No incendiary or electric ammo because that's just silly).2: Lose the Night Sense ability or at least make it an on/off option for people who want more immersion and realism. I love how at night the player is being hunted, combat becomes more challenging and it is better to run/hide than fight in most cases but than you go and add this ability... Don't you see how this works against the whole idea of night being a challenge? With the ability you are basically given wall hacks so you know where the threats are, essentially you are now, not scared or feel as though you are not under threat because you can see where all of the threats are. See what I mean? I understand you are probably just trying to make everyone happy, those who want a more realistic feeling game and a challenge and of course those who want magic and no challenge.3: Also on that note, I watched gameplay and saw the player with the magic ability I previously posted, as well as some kind of super power seismic smashing ability that makes zeds go flying back and X-Ray vision when looking for broken bones or something? (This isn't Sniper elite, please make that an on/off  option or drop it altogether) The character as a whole just has some very strange magic (or call it what you will) nonsense abilities. I would rather see the developers take a more realistic approach on the character. To me it seems like you started making a game that you wanted to be a challenge, than decided to cancel out the challenging aspects by adding silly abilities to help the player. I'm not saying make this game realistic like DayZ, just remove all the garbage that makes it similar to Dead Island. I have read over a lot of posts and it seems that the general public who are interested in this game, want to see this game's entirety be more realistic/believable. Rant.. Complete! Thanks for taking the time to read whether or not you are or aren't a Dying Light Developer. Oh and as always, for Pc anyway.. Please make this game easy for modding! a lot of the time, modders clean up mistakes and problems left behind after the game has sold. They can also do an overhaul on the game and make it better, e.g. Dead Island (No offense intended).","Feature requests",351

"1004"," I'm sure this one is already added: Imagine walking the streets of DL at night and then you hear this somewhere far away: http://youtu.be/7MTRMHMswRQ?t=52s Scary. --- I really think this game is not about the 1000 weapons or the cool skins (which are prolly nice), but this game is all about atmosphere. It sucks you in and makes you forget about your real problems for a while, and if its doing that, its accomplished its job. Like the Last of Us, you didnt play it for the weapons, but more cause of the things you experience, the things you explore and the things you see.I just dont think the game is about the big axe that has a specific camo color on it, which is glowing in the dark. I'm sure you Dev's read this article, if not give it a try: http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/26/what-makes-the-perfect-video-game I can just tell you DL has the potential to: - Be an unforgetable multiplayer- Have a great atmosphere- A well written story and characters  Just thank you to all Dev's & Co.

The undead mutated centipede female or unborn baby thing can also be like a underwater and above water special infected, maybe some escaped to the underground(Sewers) and evolved (like the Volitles do) and can now go on land (Like a centipede/snake hybrid, but more freaky looking) and can swim (Like a Sea-Snake as it pulls its crawling leg things inside of it's body when it's underwater to swim) and go after survivors (at day and at night), crying out, streaking as it chasesdown the player until it's killed. These things after they evolve, they move faster and this time can make their own sounds to lure unsuspecting victim to eat, hunt,and hunt in packs as well. When this thing is on the ground, it exhales green gas at the player when its close enough to slow him/her down then goes in for the kill (Flame and Electric weapons are effective agaisnt this thing and are semi effective when it's evolved), I call this special infected ""The RibCrawler"". 3. A Special evolved infected that is a dangerous night hunter like the Volitles, it jumps higher then volitles and can leap to other buildings and has the sameMandible jaw thing like Volitles, basically its a female version of a volitle that jumps high and leaps and climbs to hunt at night, I call this special evolvedinfected ""A Leaper"". Please do comment folks and I'll make new female undead monster mutations soon. Tell me what ya think, see ya soon.  A ""Leaper""?

"1032","Dear Dying Light developersI don't mean to complain, but the hunter should be playable all the time, instead of just playable at night. There was potential in this zombie character, you could have given the Hunter a story as well. If there are other playable characters in what you all promise to be an even better story then Dead Island, wouldn't the night hunter have some kind of involvement with the 4 survivors, or Kyle? If you think about it, the night hunter is the 5th playable character in the game, so it means it has some kind of importance, or at least I thought it did. In fact, you could have involved the zombie in the story, like have the zombie get cutscenes as well. The story would have been the same, the 4 badass survivors would try and to figure out some way they can get out of the mess, while the very rare mutation of the virus (the invader), which can THINK, is hunting them, like a slasher. Complications would arise, as both the survivors and the hunter would struggle to stay alive, while murderous humans and other messed up mutations of the virus, aim to take all of them down. Who's to say the Night Hunter is liked by all the zombies? I can imagine it getting into a fight with those giant bruisers, just to eat some poor human, who had been scavenging for food. Just saying, you guys could have put more thought into what might have been another crucial part in the storyline.ï»¿ Still, I won't complain, since be the zombie mode is just you invading other players worlds, but please don't just have us protecting hives. The zombie is called the ""The Hunter"" not the guardian, or daddy, I just want to be able to stalk other players, not fight them until they kill all the hives. I was really hoping to at least have the zombie more accessible, it would give me the time and ability to actually level up the hunter. Heck light would have been it's perfect weakness, in daylight it wouldn't be able to use it's tendrils, it would have to use parkour like the humans would, and navigate around the map to get it's prey. This is all I have to say, but I only hope you all take this under consideration. If not everything else I said, then at least have us do more with the zombie, then have us just guard hives with one. I mean it's fine, but let it be a side mission for the hunter, and take out the whole invasion mode. Being the zombie would be more fun if  you just pitted players against each other in regular story mode, and not some different mode all together. Free roaming as the zombie would be nice.Edited August 23, 2014 by Dampierre1997","Feature requests",387

You'd have to go for the eye, but even then it might not even work. What makes the ""Karambit"" and ""Trench knife"" more viable is because not only are you able to put more force in a thrust. You can also use the ""Knuckle Dusters"" on both knives, which gives you that extra blunt force. Just imagine trying to stab a zombie in the eye with those claws, but instead of puncturing right through, you bounce off of its skull.

"1058","Well, you already know what I think. I just hope to able to free roam as the hunter, and not be held down by day and night rules. If I wanted to just play at a certain time, or place a match just to play the monster, I would just have to play Evolve. You have 4 against 1, I don't have a problem since the zombie is pretty powerful, but in a match against 4 other players when guarding the hive, all they would have to do is split up, and while you're fighting 1 or 2, the others could easily go for the hives. The hunter shouldn't be held down by night either,if it needs to sleep, then let it sleep in it's own safe house like a human is able to. That gives the zombie player the choice to seek out other people who are playing in day or night. As for getting into buildings, well all you'd have to do is find a conveniently broken window or open sewer hole. Anyway Han, I just hope the guys at Techland see this, I don't wanna sound like I'm complaining, but this would all be a nice feature, and it would help sell the game.

"1074","Dont know if this has been mentioned or its implemented in the story already or your cooking something up already but I wanted to add if you can prevent your zombification. In the game your character isnt immune to the zombie infection but is already infected, he just hasnt turned yet which allows him some ""zombie powers"" like the night vision, etc. Although for what reason hasnt he turned? Is it just repressed? Slowly turning as the game ages on? Does it take a while to kick in depending on the depth of the infection? What if in the game there was some kind of medicine that slowed the process of the zombification. While playing you have to find, collect and make sure to keep up on some way to prevent a full turning of your character. Really adds to the adrenaline level, and would make crate drops especially important.","Feature requests",429
"1075","Something I really think should be in this game is a Silent Takedown that we've seen executed before in a game like Far Cry or you can do the approach of how The Walking Dead Survival Instincts did it for example with how they stab the zombie in the head to quickly take him down. But only stealthily because that was then to easy to simply throw yourself at a horde and then begin to stab everything in the face. I want it to be balanced and not a cheesy way to take out enemies. Especially since there is the stealth segment for at night. I watch Dying Light videos literally 8 times a day and new ones alike and I have yet to see the Silent Takedown so I began to wonder if it's even in the game if it's not it really should be. I think it will be a great addition to the fluidity that you guys are looking for. Because If I have to attack them to kill them from behind every time it may kinda be a bit of a pain.

I am a twitch streamer/game reviewer with quiet a large fan base and would JUMP at the opportunity to do something for you guys. Thank you Techland for your time and consideration of your fan base. YOU GUYS KICK chupacabra <- Lol I put butt except ya know, not butt  Something I really think should be in this game is a Silent Takedown that we've seen executed before in a game like Far Cry or you can do the approach of how The Walking Dead Survival Instincts did it for example with how they stab the zombie in the head to quickly take him down. But only stealthily because that was then to easy to simply throw yourself at a horde and then begin to stab everything in the face. I want it to be balanced and not a cheesy way to take out enemies. Especially since there is the stealth segment for at night. I watch Dying Light videos literally 8 times a day and new ones alike and I have yet to see the Silent Takedown so I began to wonder if it's even in the game if it's not it really should be. I think it will be a great addition to the fluidity that you guys are looking for. Because If I have to attack them to kill them from behind every time it may kinda be a bit of a pain.

"1090","Dont know if this has been mentioned or its implemented in the story already or your cooking something up already but I wanted to add if you can prevent your zombification. In the game your character isnt immune to the zombie infection but is already infected, he just hasnt turned yet which allows him some ""zombie powers"" like the night vision, etc. Although for what reason hasnt he turned? Is it just repressed? Slowly turning as the game ages on? Does it take a while to kick in depending on the depth of the infection? What if in the game there was some kind of medicine that slowed the process of the zombification. While playing you have to find, collect and make sure to keep up on some way to prevent a full turning of your character. Really adds to the adrenaline level, and would make crate drops especially important.In the video you pick up a serum looking thing from the supply delivery, maive it is that, a kind of zombificacion supressorEdited September 11, 2014 by bukan","Feature requests",445
"1091","I have a few simple ideas on how to make this game even more fast paced and heart pounding: 1. Randomly spawning spilled petrol:Imagine it's night time and you are desperately running away from the horde. Suddenly you see some gas petrol dripping from a car or a barrel. You equip your lighter, throw it in the spilled petrol and boom goes half of your pursuers! Of course that would require you to run the hell away because all the zombies in a mile radius would go mental. 2. Quarantine crews being a threat:Let's say they are not willing to trust you and instead just shoot at you in case you have a weapon equipped. You could approach the with your weapons lowered and get some free items or, if they freak out and shoot at you, shoot back or let them get killed by the zombies. 3. No sniper rifles:It's a parkour game. We all know that parkour games get lower ratings if the player stops every 5 seconds to aim down sights. And yes I was referring to the ""most hyped parkour FPS game that we have all forgotten about in a month."" ","Feature requests",446

"1094","One thing i would love to see in this game is the ability to have a group of survivor that you could call on for assistance if u get in a sticky situation. Like say your stuck on a van and there is a swarm of zombie below. Having the ability radio for a team such as like 2-4 survivors to help clear them out. Also this group would not just be for lets say clearing out zombies. But also how about after they clear out the zombies they set up a little area and bring supplys for you maybe like ammo,food,guns crafting gear and they stay for so long then leave. Also having the ability to bring one of the survivors with you would also be neat as well.  p.s I'm really into the survival aspects of this game i really hope its not a just a fast paced run and gun game because they get old fast for me. Having some type of side activity other than blow this up and being forced to do things is kinda past the point of having a zombie apocalypse. In a survival aspect i find having the ability to actually choose my own path and creating my own goals is kind fun and giving me a more creative aspect of a game. As well have allowing me to create my own content to add to game adds a whole new level to the game for me. 1. Add modding tool kit (nexus mods Dying light nexus?)2.

"1095","I think I maybe be late for this one but here are my ideas (my apology if someone had already bring brought up the point)1) Rather then waiting for mission which I hope it pops up randonly from day to night, we are allow to scavage for supplies, risk is there and will always be which rewards in Exporation. Story of people, good loot. Raiding, Supplies and etc. 2) Radio Tech support from friend. Skype/Raidcall are fun with friends but if there is Walkie system that allows your friend to have a Birds eye view to aid you will be very fun. This also helps in PvP mode for best route with less crash between teams. Downside is this will alert nearby Zombies with Sounds and bring them to each location (both sender (cause talking) and receiver (unless he found/made an in-ear set). Turning on or off is an option 3) Allows camp out option. I love to have sometime I just won't able to get back to base in time so keep low profile. Both light and sounds gives out location which makes no mistakes at night or it will be a ticket to Death. Which also brings to my next point, allow construction of sub base as well. (restock supplies) but will never be 100% safe from the Zombies (unless built on a very safe location) 4) Zombie isn't a bashing bag, I will love them be as deadly as they can because I want them to overpower us no matter how good we get (both skills and gear) 5) Trap Trap Trap, I love to see both Zombies and Humans walk into my trap and it turns against them from explosive to sound trap.Edited September 16, 2014 by Val","Feature requests",450

"1107","1) in this game when you see a survivor trapped I wish you's could extend on this and maybe see a survivor running away from zombies and you got to kill them and escort him to a safe area. 2) I like the idea of having a safe house maybe something small and as the game progresses you can get your safe house to become bigger and have better strength. 3) I don't know how this would work because I think this would make the game be easy but if you could have like a bed to sleep in but not make it as easy as that it would be great. 4) can you add this ability where you can have a pick lock or a thing called something like strong foot where you can practically break down or pick lock any building on the game or most building so it feels like real life where you can just break a door down when you want.And I've been watching every video for this game and there only seems to be things like arm traps collect crates and that but I was wondering does this storyline have a meaning because to make a game great it has to have a long and an amazing storyline.Thank you and if any of these are taken onboard that'll be great Another thing is you should also do it so say if you are in a house or on the street you should make it so hordes can be anywhere not just on like the highway and that just to make it that little bit more fun.","Feature requests",462

You can call that realistic mode, you have no secound life and then you can play coop with your frieds with different characters and character Customizing, because the node is not included in the story. You can bring at a dlc later. You can safe the game, but when all of you die the data would be deleted. Thats an realistic ""free the city"" mode maybe with different difficuties.

There is park our for a reason and if you have watched any of the gameplay demos, there isn't really much space to drive.","Feature requests",479
"1125","It would be good if when you see a survivor when you save him he goes to your camp and the more people you recruit the stronger your camp becomes. Another good thing is that you should make it so your camps can come under attack and you got to save themIt would be nice to see survivors in the safe zone after you save them, and the more you have the safe zone begins to change, for example it begins as a fast built camp,but then gets barbed wire and watch towers after certain number of survivors, or it expands and sometimes gets attacked.","Feature requests",480
"1126","I have quite a few ideas and questions regarding Dying Light. I will try to put it all in one post. 1. It would be cool if there were infected animals. I think since it is an urban environment, dogs would work well?For example: you walk into a room because you hear a cry for help, all of a sudden, a dog jumps on your face and you must throw it off. 2. You guys have already stated that there will be multiplayer for up to 4 people, I think it would be cool if there could be 2-3 groups of four people.For example: two supply drops are dropped. All the groups go after them (naturally). One group arrives to the first package and loots it. While the other two groups arrive at the second drop and must fight or share its contents. 3. If 2. is to be implemented maybe make it possible to steal from the enemy's safe-house? 4. It would be interesting to be able to see hints of enemy presence.For example: A flock of birds fleeing a supply drop zone could mean that an enemy faction has already arrived. Or rats fleeing an alleyway could mean that numerous infected are around the corner. 5. I would LOVE to see lots of weapon mods, all I've seen so far is electrical wire wrapped around a shiv? I would love to see others like fire, barbed wire fence to make them bleed, etc. 6. Also will there be a specific skill tree that revolves around crafting? I've only heard of Agility and Strength. Maybe more like Crafting, Survivor Sense, Proficiency (for being better with certain tools, like the flashlight ) 7. Cross-System Multiplayer? I am playing on PlayStation 4 and would like to be able to play with my PC and Xbox friends as well. 8. I would like to know if the flashlight will be using a battery? And if so, how common are the batteries? 9. I expect firearms and their ammunition will be VERY scarce. 10. I saw the Co-Op gameplay and noticed that the screen went black before the ""Kill the infected"" challenge started. Maybe make it more seamless? Press a button and activate the mini game? 5 seconds to make the choice? I dunno. 11. Do we get to customize our safe-houses to make them more comfortable? If so see 11. 12. I noticed spike traps, electric fences and car bombs (Is that what they're called?). Will we be able to place these around our safe-house? 13. Are the Volatiles killable? Or is the only possible choice running? Or are they just REALLY hard to kill? 14. EASTER EGGS!!! I love finding references to popular culture and other games. See my post on this here. 15. Can we craft firecrackers? If so how hard would it be to gather all the supplies to do so? 16. Do we get other throwables aside from firecrackers? Maybe a dust bomb, caltrops, or even some sort of (hard to attain) explosive? My hopes aren't too high on the explosives, but I honestly don't see anything wrong with dust bombs, not too sure about caltrops. 17. I personally feel like split screen should be part of the game. It was highly anticipated in Dead Island and is much wanted in Dying Light. I understand your reasons for not implementing it but I honestly think that it should be up to us, the players, as to whether or not we want to use it. But! If you think it does not fit, then go with your gut instinct! 18. MOAR DLCS!!! 19. I would like to know more about the Grapple. Will it be crafted? Will it be bought? Is it tied to the story? Is it part of some skill tree? 20. I have seen some weapons being thrown, a knife and a tomahawk I believe. Are these weapons special? Do you have limited throws? Can we craft them? 21. How often will we find ziplines? 22. Could you explain why people are sending supply drops to a quarantined zone? Or would this be stepping into spoiler territory? 23. Spears? I've only seen guns, blades and blunts. 24. User created content? It greatly increases the life and popularity of the game. 25. I love when **** hits the fan and you have to improvise and stray from the original plan, like when the night hunter strikes while you're running back to a safe-house, Or when the demolisher attacks you on the way to a supply drop, Sudden hordes of zombies, Volatiles gets the adrenaline running. 26. Weather? 27. How many safe-houses will there be across the game? Lastly, I would like to point out some features that I really like about Dying Light: -I think you guys nailed it with the parkour, I hadn't even thought about jumping off of zombies!-Interesting multiplayer-Cool weapon crafting idea-Zombies are tougher at night-Tons of zombie types-And I just LOVE this game altogether. Thanks so much for listening!  Jeez, what a long post.Edited October 10, 2014 by Stealthief","Feature requests",481

"1128","First, A gamemode i will call Risks&Rewards A sort of Fragile alliance gamemode for multiplayer where 4-6 players have an objective of getting to a supply drop with loot (or whatever is in them) and retrieving it for small to moderate rewards, But the twist is that at ANY time one of your ""Teammates"" could turn on you (not become a zombie) and kill you or another teammate and the killer is now a ""Rogue runner"" Where he splits off by himself and if he gets the supply drop its all for him but the rest of the alive players are trying to kill him and the player who was ""Backstabbed"" Is now a goon or special zombie tasked with killing the rest of the players before they get to the supply drop and then destroying the supply drop to keep secrets ""under wraps"" (Possible reason for the green chip in the trailer?) if they are a goon or just killing players if they are a zombie. A lot more things:  1. Will there be a weapon damage system as seen in dead island? (Weapons break and need repairs) 2.Bola type weapons that slow down/ stop enemies with possible status effects (electricity,flame,ETC)? 3. Gore detail, How far can i cut down the zombies (Mince meat,chunkie or slabs?) 4. Destruction, If a goon is chasing me can he destroy walls or even buildings to slow me down? 5. Damage, If i fall off of a building and land in a horde of zombies and then i get bitten, will i walk away with a broken leg (-25% movement speed)and a bite(-25% health and slow decay towards turning?) or one or just some health damage 6. PLEASE NO ZOMBREX STYLE COLLECTION, Dont add a feature like zombrex in DR 1 or DR 2 where i need to break up my fun to get a object or game over 7. Please no time limit or no return area, Don't add a time limit to my fun or a NO RETURN zone like in dead island it really made me a bit mad when i saw the timer or when the game told me i couldnt return from the prison with my loot. 8. Food and stuff, If you add food or something or other make us want it (NOT NEED, BIG DIFFERENCE), Buffs for eating it (other than health regen) and maybe debuffs if i don't eat something for a long time. ( I know there will be no hunger/thirst bar) 9. Variety, You said earlier i could throw firecrackers to distract enemies, please make these look different each time, just a colour or different animation or texture on the firecrackers something to add variety, same with healing items and guns (After eating my 50th apple in DI1 i wondered, No oranges in Banoi? just apples?) 10.Cool weapons, Looks like you are already doing Great with these but just want to make sure there are weird and exotic weapons unique to the city I'm in or just unique in general. like the weapon in the E3 2014 gameplay trailer at 0:51-0:52 that was cool 11. Please no bullet sponge enemies, I bought destiny lately and have been playing and most of the bosses are just big enemies with REALLY HIGH Hp no difficulty, they are just tedious so make sure Normal enemies die in 2-3 hits and specials die after a ton but have a weakness making them MUCH easier to bring down 12. Easily accesible lore, Make a handbook or something giving detailed info about each enemy from the characters POV (please dont make these collectibles) just by meeting them but you wont know about weaknesses or strengths until you experience them or learn them from an NPC in exchange for supplies (Possibly an NPC will give you false info sometimes?) 13, the last one, Other enemies than zombies, Zombies are cool and all but eventually they will get boring to fight so maybe mix it up by having an enemy faction that has a Hierarchy  that changes (Similar to the Shadow of mordor Nemesis system) and lives its own life during yours (I know that you are in a late development stage so this may not be possible)","Feature requests",483

Nothing would be better without a companion wether a raccoon, to a mouse, to a dog, to a Komodo dragon, to a BEAR that towers over enemies and they dare to go against my fluffy fella don't forget to add vultures With all I've mentioned in PETSMouse: This little guy bites enemies tanks they snap their tools in half and bite that fat Zombies belly! They can also bite off a limb or two.ðŸ‘½ They can die off of explosives so watch out with what zombies you want them to deal with.Dog: Pretty original, but pretty helpful dogs bite and tear doing more damage than mice and raccoons they can die from explosives and can get hurt but don't fear, feed them zombie meat!Raccoon: They hide, they stalk, and they rip through their enemies. They do as much as damage as mice but they do it quickly and more than just a bite, their claws! They scratch and scratch and scratch, blinding your enemy, while shredding their face off especially on humans. While you finish him (Mortal Kombat reference)Komodo dragon: They are quick so watch out! They can kill your enemy pretty slowly, but their poison doesn't... They can hold off a zombie(tugging their leg and poisoning their leg) while you bash that zombies headBears: Human enemies COWER before you as you and this menacing creature comes out and for zombies, dare they try to touch your bear, dare you try to touch that bear. I sound like your mother don't I? Anyways this bear can grab and throw zombies to desired direction, but they are slow so parkour won't help.

"1134","I agree with the eagle vision. This is not for this game. But the idea is good. A bear of course is not an option, but dogs are realistic. Unfortunatly its not an option for this game, because its all about parkour and the only pets that can keep up with you are monkeys and ones that can fly. And i dont think that they will implement it, because monkeys dont live in this area and you cant catch and train eg. A bird this easy.  Good idea, but not for this game.Keep thinking =)Edited October 19, 2014 by Killer Phoppel","Feature requests",489

"1136","I completely agree with ""Suisidal"" (sorry if I misspelled your account name). I know Tech Land has said some elements have been added but all aspects of that should be added. I also think it should just be in multiplayer I think it should be in single player as well. One of the main parts of a zombie apocalypse is to find or make shelter and to keep zombies out. I have yet to find a zombie game that allows you to do this. I think that if this is incorporated in dying light that may generate more sales and completely alter gameplay! It would be scary to return to your base to find out that it's infested with the zombie horde and you now either have to find new shelter of be brave enough to clean out and reclaim your home. This would be an awemazing feature to add especially with the day and night cycle.  I seriously suggest the feature. PS: I already have my copy of the game pre-ordered!!! I went to gamestop!!!","Feature requests",491
"1137","I don't know whether this has been asked before since I haven't read through this entire topic. I know the developers have said the gore will be customisable but have they said how so? Will it be a simple turn off/on system, where you can simply have the gore or not at all (I'm hoping this isn't the case, but thought I'd mention it anyway)? Or will it be more in depth, with multiple options like no severing limbs, less blood, etc? ","Feature requests",492

And when you choose if you dont like for example the hair or clothes you can change it. I would really love it if you can do that( If you dont its ok, still love the game). i think it will help very much for the producers to do that.  Also another idea is since i saw that in the game you wont have to worry about food or water or etc. You can join a faction and then the 'leader' sents you to get food or water or medical supplies or even weapons or even try to find survivors. Also can you go to another city??? ( Sorry for my english)Edited October 25, 2014 by TheDreamingWriter","Feature requests",497

"1160","What happened???At first, this was more of the freerunning spirit or the parkour spiritNow it's a hack and slashIts as if they threw away the parkour elementsFocus on the parkour, The ,""Run boy Run"" trailer is a perfect example they put a good use in freerunning Also I'd like to see a feature from the 12 minute gameplay backSo new dying light videos come out and I see when the main character/protagonist(Kyle Crane) climbs a wall with his weapons the weapons disappear and all you see his hands slap the wall and he climbs itAs what I suggest is that he has his weapon on his right hand and you see his left hand pulling him up from the wallSo if you climb with an axe, the axe will still be shown on the right hand but you see the left hand pulling him upI know, it's the small things that get me...","Feature requests",515
"1161","Hi! I am really looking forward to this game - can't wait! Stop judging, Vetle.I do have a suggestion, though. What if you could make a function that allows you to make a gameface for the character you play with. It would be sick, especially to play in co-op with your mates and see their faces. If it doesn't take alot of work to put this in, you should.

"1162","Hello Techland , after I saw the new awesome ""Dying Highlight: Epic Fails"" Video there was something i was thinking about:What is going to happen after you die in Dying Light? Will it be like in Dead Island that you respawn after a few seconds close to your death point? Or do you have to load your last quick save? Can we only save our game when we are in a safehouse? (That would be very hard!)If you do it like you did it in Dead Island i think there will be a huge problem:The game is F***ing awesome! For example, because of the amazing Atmosphere! I can see and feel it already: The fear, the tingle in my neck while sneaking around the infected and running away from the Volatiles! I want to feel the little hope that is left to see the sunlight again! But... If I spimply respawn in the near of my death point loosing some money (I hope there will be no money in a zombie apocalypse and the money that we can see in the first gameplay demo was only a place holder) or some stuff i am carring destroy the atmosphere at night and the intention to survive. If I spawn at my last checkpoint its like I never have done this stuff i have done in the time between the checkpoint and my last death. Its hard when you forgot to save your game so a quicksafe option would be very nice. What do you think techland?Than I saw that you are going to make a collectors edition and is it true that you only will make it for poland? That would be very sad because i am a very very very huge fan of Dying Light And last question: I live in Germany and the german gamers have some problems with the USK... I know that your plan is to release the game here and that is awesome! But I want the full Dying Light and no cuttet version  Do you guys know more? PS: The game you are creating is the best game I have ever seen! I have a shortcut on top of my browser that shows me all the recent results of dying light in the last 24 hours and i click on this botton 5 to 10 times every day since the first gameplay trailer on E3 2013 was out (randomly on my birthday). You have amazing new ideas and you build a beautiful and huge city with a incredible amount of details! I can see how much love you put in this game and how much fun you have while showing it to us! I read and saw every interview and a read every articel, saw every presentation and watch every video frame by frame to see every detail that is possible so i knew everything that is possible to know about this game and i knew a lots of rumors about parts and funktions in the game that might be true.

So thank you, thank you for making a game that will change our gamer lifes  JolukThe reason for give up on last gen consoles is that you wouldnt have the experience they want you to. I am shure that they will release it uncensored, because when it is, thats the worst experience for a zombie game ( just mentioned l4d series) it is more realistic that they cancel the german version so that you can import the us version e.g.than censore it. Otherways they lied to us when they gave the reason for cancelling last gen and you have to think about if they are really that awesome they appeares to be. But i think and hope they are.  love you techland < 3Edited November 14, 2014 by Killer Phoppel","Feature requests",518

"1166","Ideas And Feature Requests For Dying Light Developers.","Feature requests",521
"1167","Add more player in co op and also in be the zombie mode. At least make it so we can play with friend in be the zombie mode.","Feature requests",522
"1168","Hello to survivors and dev crew of Techland  First of all, i want to tell you, that you've done a great job! Even if we just saw a few of gameplayes and trailers, I am so excited to play your game!How ever, i know i'm a little bit too late but i hope you'll think about my ideas and maybe implement it with a DLC or sth like that. Ok my Ideas are about the random chaos that we'll meet on the streets and i hope to give you another point of view: -I saw in your trailers that there will be a lot more zombies than in dead island. But more is not enough. Give us the chance to rescue survivors (NPC) which are hunted by a horde of Zombies(Like running through the city, crying for help and so on). -Like in the famous post apocalyptic zombie survival serie ""The Walking Dead"" some zombies could walk around in groupes. So if you think if you're save, a groupe gushes out of a narrow street and you have to run.Maybe with some sort of boss zombies. -Give us a achievment like: ""You have a gun? I have spoon!"" (Finish the story without using a gun) -Like in Skyrim you could give us the chance to lockpick ""treasures""/doors of secret rooms with better loot -Decrease the range of the hook Also add some new weapons, maybe unmodifiable:-Crossbow-Compoud bow-Garden tools Ok thats it. I can't wait for this game  but if you need more time to give us the best zombie game ever made, take it! How ever, it will be great!","Feature requests",523
"1169","Things I'd wish to see in the final game, at least in some form: -A couple of well designed gamemodes, just like The Thief mode described earlier in this post. The game has alot more replayability if those are included. -A big enough map so that there is enough space for almost limitless exploration. The map complexity can be increased by making all building interiors accessible by players and npcs, by adding height with towers, radio masts, poles and such, or by adding deep spaces, like cellar levels to larger buildings or maybe a city-wide sewer system  -Finalised and tested multiplayer. It's often the final word in many players' decision to buy the game or not, unless they are huge fans like me. In single player games or lousy multiplayer games, the replayability is often not the best, making current players get tired of the game easily, and making new buyers stick away from it. Also, facing non-AI enemies is unpredictable and fun! -Complex crafting system, weapons and loot. A wide variety of melee and ranged weapons is a very interesting part of combat games of any kind. If Dying Light brings in that, the game's fun factor and exploration becomes so much more interesting. I really hope too that the crafting isnt similar and stupid like in DI. Loot is also important, a key part of any fun exploration. Locked chests might need a lockpick/lock destroying features built in the game, that can also be a part of a complex skill tree. Having other skills in there than combat skills makes it interesting and while the player puts points in those skills, the enemies stay more difficult for a longer period of time. In the end, who doesnt like finding awesome loot after long search?  -Combat system. It might be one of the key elements needed for the game. In case analog combat doesnt make it to the game, keep the limb/body part targeting simple and efficient. Make the legs destroyable, by allowing the biters to crawl and drag their legless bodies across the surface, until the body takes too much damage to go on. Explosions are brilliant and fun in any game, as long as theyre well made, too. In DI, the explosives werent much fun, except for the flying enemy corpse pieces. Combat takedowns support both sneaky characters and action heroes, are cool and helluva lot of fun. -A variety of enemies brings depth to the game, both in combat, exploration and possibly even surprises to the campaign. A zombie game that has lots of enemies to offer is always awesome. -Non constricting sandbox elements. I hate facing invicible walls in maps, areas that are not accessible yet and enemies you cannot kill. I understand that there is limits to the map, but dont show them to the players. Use innovative techniques to conceal the limits behind something. In Harran, quarantine walls are probably the best solution  -Keep the bugs and glitches as minimal as possible. Try to make everything balanced. And listen to players. Let us help with the bug hunt  -In the pre-order version, keep the Night Hunter exclusive for us pre-orderers, for reals. Often deals like this are broken in matter of months. Sure, let the other players play the mode too, but keep your promises, or the pre-orderer players like me will most likely be pissed off to some point :/ -And most importantly, make it a game you all can be proud of. An independant piece of art that sticks out of the crowd and that you all enjoyed making of! Thats how good games come to be ","Feature requests",524
"1170","And please keep the grappling hook under control and not overpowered. It kind of takes some of the challenge of parkouring away. Or make it a an item that only becomes available later in the story. It could also work as a weapon, too ","Feature requests",525
"1171","I don't know if you already thought of this or what I saw Dying Light instantly feel in love with it. But I do have a recommendation for the game that I can guarantee will boost sales. Make the game for current gen consoles not just next gen. After saying you are going to and than as the date gets closer and people get happier you destroy that. It is going to make a lot of people mad. I may only be speaking for me and for my 11 friends that were planning to get it, but we are incredibly pissed off about your announcement. You could possibly do what WB did with LOTR: SOM and just delay the release for current consoles it will still make people pissed off but a lot less will of your customers will stop saying they will never pick up anything with Techland on it.          well I think that techland dropping last gen is amazing personally. That means the devs won't hold the game back and not hold dying light up to its full potential. Like, c'mon. If dying light was on last gen and current gen and they pushed both systems then it wouldn't be equal. On last gen there would be less zombies, lesser graphics, run less smoother. Compared to current gen. So I'm happy that techland made this choice. I understand ure pain ""if u don't have a ps4"" but I suggest buying one if I didn't already, like on Christmas. Cheers!","Feature requests",526

"1173","Hi Developers,I think your game, Dying Light, should have HUNGER and THIRST because this would enhance gameplay a lot more.

I know your pretty much done with the game and this is a major change, but This would really make this a way more enjoyable game.

In the end, we decided not to include it into the game, because it proved to detract too much from gameplay and break the pacing of the game. The player has quite a lot to keep track of, even without the need to constantly look for food and water. The game will still have you scavenging and competing over air supply drops, just without having to be constantly aware of your hunger and thirst levels."" - Source: Dying Light FAQ","Feature requests",529
"1175","And oh, I hate my ""spam"" / sending this much message per day, but a few idea's were haunting my restless mind. Here are the latest thoughts and gameplay feature wishes in the head of the hoovy: Visible damage on the player: This idea is totally unique. Its basically having the character model change with every bit of damage from external sources that hits the player, to be displayed on the character's body. It fits the story perfectly. As I recall Pawel earlier stating that the meds and pills have a certain role in the game, this idea would make them even more necessary for fighter characters. As a zombie would hit you, you might not get any kind of changes to your model, just lose a bit health. Over time, you could get bruisings and torn up skin that youd have to deal with pills. When shot, you could get bullets stuck in your arms and body to be pulled off, when falling you could end up with a broken leg that youd have to bandage or when bitten, the wound might even get infected. Not necessarily with the Biter Infection, but anything at all. I bet a walker mouth is overflooded with bacteria and viruses from all the dead meat that has been rotting there. There could be matching pills for different problems, like common aspirin for all sorts of small cuts, and heavier antibiotics for bacterial infections. All these could be rare, too, in case stacking meds to your backbag would become too common...Who knows, you might have a medical character available at a safehouse to sell medical items and services for scraps. This idea also works with other NPCs  and missions around the map. The NPC characters could have been injured earlier, opening a possibility for a rescue mission, like ""Help a broken legged survivor back to your base"" which would restrict you from reaching the safehouse too fast, or even a gamemode, where you couldnt get injured severely or maybe chasing down an injured thief. It adds alot of depth to the game, with just some programming and simple model changes  A beautiful soundtrack/Good sound effects and voice acting. You might have to hire an experienced composer to make this happen, or maybe you just need someone that is experienced with complex atmospherical music skills and someone who is unemployed/freelancing. It makes me always feel so amazed to have good music played to my ears when gaming, as music is half of my life, I could say. Who doesnt want this to the game? All it can do is make it better, unless you mess it up somehow  On the other hand, if the voice acting goes wrong, its a serious case, as it takes believability and atmosphere out of the game. Cliched actors with crappy, unmotivated voices does only bad for the game. Have the actors and sound effects reviewed well before release, please  Environmental variety around the map: Things like loose bridges, hidden caches, lots of locked up places, including doors, lockers, rooms and such. Maybe a house festered with infection cloud, making it hard to access without special equipment. Hard to reach places, like lifted bridges or trapped entrypoints to buildings. Worked pretty damn well imo with Skyrim and Fallout 3. A bear trap here and there brings excitement to any scavenge run. Also works with my aforementioned idea, a leg stuck with a bear trap could get broken or start bleeding  Stealthy stuff, like silencers to some firearms, possibly craftable even, crossbows or simpler bows, even possibly with added modding features. This could also include wearable items. Changing into special ops shoes might prove to be quieter way to sneak around than your old boots. The surprise factor. It makes so many mediocre games, (which Dying Light most certainly wont be) alot more fun, but in either case, it adds variety and the feeling that you actually are there and that you ought to prepare for anything at all. Practically it would be random encounters with survivors, randomising loot lockers a bit, setting a trap here or there, maybe making a car alarm go off randomly after a zombie would try to climb it, giving you the feeling something big is going on. It would certainly lift the atmosphere and excitement, too, which I think is pretty important in Dying Light. Rare mods. Make most of the modifications to weapons rare, and poweerful, please. In dead island, you sometimes got a zapping or maybe a burning effect. It sort of sucked. The ""run, boy, run"" trailer showed activating the special electricity on a melee weapon for a hit. This would make it alot more easy to use. A weapon modification which works about 1/10 of the time would probably be somewhat unrealistic or possibly a very badly made modification.. Dont forget the sheer amount of them, though. Fire, electricity and bleeding hopefully arent the only ones around, too  Limit both the grappling hook and the ""sense"" skills for survivors. The earlier makes the movement pretty much too easy for most, unless its a late game find, and the latter takes away surprise and danger factor. Sense skill could be an upgradable part of the stealth skill tree, or maybe it could have a cooldown of sorts. Also, detecting special zombies kind of sucks imo. Keep it within limits, please  Early challenges. When the player is a newcomer to the city, dont let them feel like theyre in control for a long time in the story. Finding more advanced weapons, loot and chupacabra too early and too easily makes the player spoiled and ruins the feeling of actually accomplishing something really good and big. The learning curve is a way to make this happen. The starting parkouring skills should be very limited. The amount of available supplies should be low. Your enemies should be numerous, also for the late game too, and friends very few. One doesn't simply walk to the Mordor, right?  Special infected request: Someone who pins the player down. This can easily be a Demolisher or a Screaming kid zombie, but an infected that specialises in this could be really scary. Look at Left 4 Dead; Hunters, Chargers and Smokers are always a scary foe unless you have a teammate nearby. Of course, you always cannot have a helping hand nearby, so, there should be an option to fight the constriction/pull/strangling or whatever you people at Techland would want to have. If you somehow got pinned down, near a horde, it would be an amazing challenge, even for the experienced badasses  Aaand dont let anyone tell you what to do.

Nice one!  So now - the thank you part.  Guys, thank you so, so much for all of your posts - seriously, you have no idea how much love we have for you for putting all of your thoughts down in this thread.

In dying light, it could be made that standing on the roof of a car isn't a sanctuary (this is probably already so with running / parkour zombies seen in gameplay video).But...

Anyone behind that post seems to be too late to wish anything. Maybe you guys could instead start planning for DLC'S or something  Also, they canceled ps3 and xbox360 because they would hold the game back. Update your pc or your console, stop crying about it, it wont change a thing. The decicion to leave them out has already been made In dead Island whenever you were standing on top of a car, the zombies would just approach the side and flail about, as if they weren't even trying. In dying light, it could be made that standing on the roof of a car isn't a sanctuary (this is probably already so with running / parkour zombies seen in gameplay video).But... Wouldn't it add a bit more to the game if zombies were able to grab your legs and pull you off cars, or maybe even bite your legs? This game is advanced many more years. If you look at the trailers/gameplay videos available at Youtube, the players never start camping on cars. And the infected rush in pretty quickly. Plus, there are special zombies already in Dying Light, like the puking one that would make it hot to stand around one for too long, the volatiles, which can jump in with you and make you fall, and even the big demolisher ones, which can go as far as throw the whole car, with you on it.

"1184","Not sure if this has been requested, but this doesn't necessarily effect gameplay. I was wondering if you guys are implementing any type of scarring/aging system?

"1187","Do not do a hunger/thirst idea as that's DAYZ related and DayZ is already a heavily modded game from the original idea. Please ensure this time with side missions that they are not the same as Dead Island / Riptide where you can do the same thing over and over by giving someone food or bottles to make molotovs. I'd like to see the ability to share meds/food etc with people you meet who need them and gain extra points that way. And also bring the people back to your base or have them tag along helping you with missions so they could be used to help or if you were bad then used as bait. Because the trailer says ""What happens when all that is good in us... Has Gone ? What would that monster look like ?""So instantly because one game has it no other game can?  I actually quite enjoy the idea of having ongoing quests, maybe not as many as were in the mentioned games but one or two here and there wouldn't hurt. This part I actually agree with 100% being able to save or sacrifice the locals would be cool however doing this should be limited during the night (like some of them are scared of the night and go home/to the safe house)Edited November 27, 2014 by CraziePookie","Feature requests",542

Well yea so when you get near a player then he hear it.. and talk louder you will hear much futher when u scream it goes rlly far???And one amazing idea i came up with was: Voice chat zombie attention! So when you talk pretty loud in voice chat then zombies might hear you... but its only when u talk like little loud.. so you need to be normal and sometimes when ur pretty close den u can't talk loud .. you can whisper or something.. but yea you guys can think about it.. i think its cool idea  If u can't make it, its okey  buy yea.. will be awesome!!Can't wait for DYING LIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!  :)  :) BEST GAME IV'E EVER SEEN!! THANKS!!!","Feature requests",544
"1190","If this game has a save/respawn system like Dead Island it's going to suck. There was no fear with that save system. There was no chance of failure. The player deserves a chance to fail that way when they succeed its actually rewarding. Players need to fear the crowd of zombies. If the instantly respawn with only a minor XP or cash penalty. They'll just farm that back in a safer area. Maybe use a system simalar to Left 4 Dead. If someone in your party dies they can only be resurected at a check point. And if everyone in your party dies you have to start over from the last save point. Come up with a better save system than Dead Island or this game is already doomed. Seriously if this games handles player deaths like Dead Island shoot it in the head, because its already mediocre.","Feature requests",545
"1191","well, unfortunately i don't speak a fluent english, and because of that i wasn't read all suggestions before posting here. The point is: sorry if i post something repeated.I'm counting on the help of a web translator to write and express my ideas in best possible way. i'll post some ideas, tell me if have any good idea, and the points: pros and con. 1- 4 humans versus 4 zombies (no hunters, the others special zombies)the human team need complete a some objective that the special zombie team need stop they to win.another objective to this gamemode can be a time limit. can make a new special zombie not will be so stronger like hunter, but a parkuor zombie that will follow and try ambush the human team. 2- 4 humans versus 4 humans, two teams, i dont know much about the history but i have impression that have two sides, right? in this 4 humans vs 4 humans, to win will need to complete some objectives and will need dribble and kill the zombies in your ways. The human team ""A"" will need kill the human team ""B"", the team ""B"" need kill team ""A"" too, obviously. can make a gamemode that ""which team will survive more time?""humans versus humans, will have zombies in the map to disturb the teams, will have a chronometer, a limit of time, for example 20 minutes, in 20 minutes will appear a enormous horde of zombies that will kill both humans teams, the last team alive will win the match.the objective of this gamemode is kill the human adversary team before the time ends.  3- if this idea does not escape the game theme, what you think about a flying zombies? with wings?  tell me if anything of my text is wrong or confused to understandEdited December 7, 2014 by ALgir","Feature requests",546

"1193","As someone who practices parkour, im in love with the game. A lot of the stuff ive seen is kinda basic. Except the split second i saw wallrunning. Was that situational or can you do that whenever. And something i would like to see is some tic-tacs. (where you push off a vertical wall to get a little more hight) or maybe some kong vaults (where you put both hands on a near waist height obstacle and jump ""through"" your arms. I would also like to see some stuff where you dont have to jump on a longer obstacle (like a large box or car) but instead vault or slide over it. And last one, doing parkour while still being able to shoot a weapon, depending on what kind of weapon it was is what you can do while shooting it. Like being able to slide and shoot a weapon or running and shooting a pistol.","Feature requests",548
"1194","I bet the parkour will have enough mobility for all the necessary tricks. Id also be interested about that tic-tacing ","Feature requests",549
"1195","Okay finding out you took to only one MALE protagonist is upsetting to me I mean can't there be a dlfemale character and to play as well that way you have the gender issue taken care of.

There are so many dogs, birds or even goats(I could type here a lot more, but this should be enough, for an example). Please Techland, i'd love to see some infected animals, which are hunting for your life ^^ The idea is that animals, which are usually nice and friendly, turn into something really bad. Ok, thats it.

"1197","I know that Techland has stopped taking ideas but i'm putting this here because i beleive that i have the best chance of getting this read by the devs. So WHY are you taking away 60fps on ps4? wtf is the problem? I myself was looking forward to the fluid movement and extra frames compared to some recent releases. We know we have all seen gameplay which has ran perfectly on the ps4 system so tell me why did you think it to be best to take away the higher amount of frames? You might still have 1080p and i definitely don't want that any lower but you take away ALOT from the visuals when you lower the framerate I know that I and my friends are disappointed in this change and will actually make me reconsider purchasing when it will now feel like less of a high quality game. Techland, RECONSIDER THIS CHANGE! you know the game will impress many more people with the higher framerate.","Feature requests",552

I'd also like to point out in a parkour based game martial arts would also be a good idea.They arent going to shoehorn in any other playable characters at all, probably. The whole development time they've sticked with Antoine, not even giving any chance to customize him fully, just clothing...Why would it be such a big deal to play with a male character? I didnt care Tomb Raider has a female character, I even liked seeing the gameplay from the eyes of a girl character. And doesnt almost every game out there have male protagonists?I gotta agree with the dogs. They made fairly good sense in Resident Evil games. And they would also be tough, understandable adversaries, not silly or too easy at all  Allow players to upgrade, and change the bases e.g. put better defences up, and make it so the Zombies change difficulty, you could even make it so they are more intelligent the more 'younger' they are later degenerating into the normal slow Zombie.I also agree with upgrading, at least for base, and weapons additions. Hopefully it isnt just simple slight mathematical damage/force/durability changes like Dead Island had. And I hope it doesnt eat away your cash for no reason ","Feature requests",556
"1202","2 simple things that will vastly improve the fluidity of the game, for me it's the difference between a good game and a great game! 1. The ability to throw any melee weapons you are currently holding, the satisfaction that comes from landing a well aimed hammer right on a zombies decaying face would be simply second to none. (Bonus points for placing bricks around the environment, a zombie game without throwable bricks is only being held back) Do I have any condemned 2 fans in here?  2. A mirrors edge style wall run. The possibilities this would open up are endless in terms of manoeuvrability. You guys claim to have an unprecedented level of movement? I'll believe it when I'm running across the walls of Harran!  Obviously I understand that the game is already complete so basically I'm looking for someone to confirm for me that these 2 features are in the game or could easily be added at a later date. EXTREMELY excited for this game and look forward to hearing your responses.  ","Feature requests",557

"1205","I get why you'd like to see vehicles in this game, but i doubt that it will really be an option. They'd have to redesign the whole map to make vehicles even viable in the slightest way. Vehicles would also drive away the fear that comes with the night.yeah i agree, maybe bicycles because zombies could knock you off and you wouldn't have to change the map all that much but other than that vehicles will just take the fun of being attacked by zombies out of the game. btw good job techland, the game is looking sick!","Feature requests",560
"1206","I would of really loved the 60fps since techland originally targeted 60fps maybe they'll add a setting for 30fps or 60fps. I would also love to see a new split-screen mode which would be awesome to be able to free-run and annihilate hoards of undead corpses with a friend or family member to get the perfect same connection experience, and then being able to drop back out to get that ultimate single-screen experience. The game looked amazing with the gameplays and trailers I hope techland don't disappoint by unexpectedly changing the frames per second. I hope their will be no vehicles in this game to get that need-to-parkour feeling and maybe add skills to free-run fluently quick. I also wish they will update this game regularly like rockstars GTA V, and then they could add badass weapons such as chainsaws, crossbows, katanas and Bond style shoe knifes to help kicking etc. Overall this will be the best zombie horror survival game if it release as expected and advertised. 5/5 awesome  ","Feature requests",561

If it's a sandbox we need the tools! C'mon man you guys made the Call Of Juarez games and I loved that gun play! Please also add real weapons and lots of them, none of this 'cheap pistol' or 'heavy rifle' I want to bust zombies heads with a CZ-75 with a high cap mag equipped, or imagine spraying some kind of micro smg while vaulting over a low wall.

"1246","What i would love to see is a thing to make night time more challenging then ever and a thing to make ppl wanna go into the dark more and risk their lifes. For example an air drop that only makes on nights with better reward and whats the catch for this drop tho, yea it has ticking bomb on it that has to be defused only at base at and bomb defuse expert before the bomb destroy the importent supply, and with this bomb it makes away sound to distract all nearby enemies so you gotta get some sneakers man cuz you gonna have to run your chupacabra off with it, and if you suceed you get some pretty badass reward and if not, rewarding item is destroyed, something like that i know you can make something like this happend or tune the idea abit ^^ and please add genders to the game for coop so atleast we dont all look alike in the face, for example your playing with your brother or sister or girl friend or wife, you all dont look alike in general, except the costumes cuz i know you allready gonna have that in the game so, or more characters with maybe same background so it doesnt have to make to much work around it ^^ and thank you for lisstening ^^Edited December 25, 2014 by Niffshou","Feature requests",601

"1265","I haven't fully read everything in this post, so I'm sorry if this is a repeat.  I would love for there to be a field of view slider on all systems if there is not one already, because as a console player, being stuck at a lower field of view can make you very motion sick. I would love for there to be a no HUD option. I wished this was implemented in Dead Island because I had over 400 hours in Dead Island, beating the game countless times, to where I just wanted to enjoy its beauty so I wanted to turn off the HUD but I could not, sadly. Being able to fully customize the HUD in the options menu would be fantastic. Such as turning off maybe the stamina bar, minimap, just everything if you wanted to, but being able to customize it if you wanted one on but everything else off. I also hope there are more weapons than in Dead Island, and you can interact with more things, like in Skyrim, you can pick up 95% of random items lying around. This may not be useful, but I think many people would like this option. I hope there is weapon customization, I know you can combine and craft things, but maybe being able to find materials out in the wild to lets say, paint a machete all black, or paint a gun pink or just have different patterns on weapons. (random examples) Everyone loves more customization.  I've seen a few customization options (for outfits) on some YouTube channels, and I like it a lot. Although instead of being presets(they are still an option) once you unlock the gear, you can put outfits together, to customize your character even more. For example, I have 8 full outits, and I want a shirt from one, pants from another, maybe a backpack from one, and some other misc item from another, I could choose each piece I want and throw together an outfit. Also being able to save these outfits (you make) and being able to name them something, inside your menu of outfits saying ""my outfits"" or ""saved outfits."" The last thing I would like to mention is something that was already in Dead Island and I hope it makes a return to this game, with an added feature. As in Dead Island, once you beat the story you could restart without losing any character progress or weapons, I loved this feature because you could just continue to play the game as many times as you want. (as I said, I had over 400 hours) Also, I would like to see a new feature implemented. Being able to continue after you beat the story, and just free roam the entire island or city, wherever it is you're located and quarantined to. You would have to option to free roam, or restart the story. If you chose to free roam, you could restart the story simply either going into the pause menu (or main menu) and hitting restart, or just replay the final mission, and choose restart the story instead.  That is all I have to say, I loved Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, so I'm sure i will be impressed by Dying Light. I am a huge fan of the zombie genre, and I hope to see more from you soon (on dying light). Until then, Good Night, and Good Luck.  ","Feature requests",620

But i had an idea that I would like to suggest anyways.  From what I've seen so far, the game look amazing and the story seems intriging, at least at the beggining.  I don't know if this game fas a multiplayer section to join, thats not related with story mode. For me, multiplayer mode is very important to keep me playing the game after i beat story mode.   I read ppls suggestion and the 2 first posts look very entertaining.  I suggest a mode where we are all infected and about to become zombies, several air drops are launched scatered through the map and the players have to run to get it. like if its a 4 player mode, only 3 air drops will be available. and for each air drop you lose you start to become a zombie, but are not out of the game. As a zombie you can kill the remaining players, the last one to survive wins. PvP is not actually avaiable only PvZombie (that happens to be a player).  Well thats it. I only hope they give a last check on this and consider on releasing a later multiplayer secction for this game. Cheers!!!!","Feature requests",624

"1297","First off i want to say that I'm totally excited for this game! I've been in a plateu in terms of gaming as I have a hard time finding games worth my while. I'm basically just waiting for the european release on the 30th. Which fits me perfectly, on a friday, so i'll be driving home for a weekend with epic fun! Now, back to the ideas, there's been alot of good ideas here, allthough some i feel would alter the whole definition and feel of the game, which i think should be avoided as it seems to be a pretty sweet game as of now. I do not think or like the idea of it going from what it is today, to a more day-z like game(with its modifications). Anyhow, I haven't read every idea suggested however I'm certain they are all good. Big credits to the moderator(s) who do a good job in going through all the posts here. I'm not sure i have any new and exciting ideas of my own to come with at this time, however, I'd like to point out one of the first, and maybe other ideas which i found especially good; 1. The CO-OP vs CO-OP mode suggestion. As a moderator pointed out there are challenges in terms of implementing such a system/mode. However i find it a great idea, and it wouldn't have to be as much as 4 groups as 4, even with 2 groups i think it would be amazingly fun and give that extra edge gameplaywise. Using the same drop-in drop-out method they are using for single CO-OP already. Now while this obviously won't be implemented for the release, it's definitely something to consider for later on. 2. We already know Be-The-Zombie mode where you can highjack someone else's game(at night) is implemented, however, Would it not be fun if more than 1 player could join a given game as the zombie? Obviously this would need balancing, the Nighthunter/stalker? whever the name would have to be slightly less powerfull (at least from my point of view) should it be possible for more than 1 person to join as zombie. (this might have been suggested earlier, if so, I'm sorry for double posting). The idea if you will, came after my friend saying to me(after I told him about the be-thezombie mode) ""Hell yea, we're gonna do that, go into someones game and make them chupacabra themselves"" , where i sadly had to say that only one could join as zombie at the time in any given game (at least that what i've gotten out of it? is this true? ) 2.5 as an extension of 2. 2.5 would be a combinastion of 1 and 2, where quite simply 4 players can join as zombies at night, but that again would mean the zombies(player controlled) would need to be toned down for balancing. But toning them down just a little and having 2 be able to join (i.e 2v4) might just give it the extra flare and be enough to give survivors that extra uncertanty at night. Not that i don't think 1 is scary enough  Anyways, cheers! Can't wait. Keep up the good work, and keep the videos coming until release, i love watching techland show off this awesome game!. Best Regards SurvivorKahn","Feature requests",652

I'd like us (players) to go around gathering resources (like wood and metal) and then building like a small house or just some type of shelter. I'd also like to see an open world that supports more than 4 players, way more than 4, maybe like 100+ then people can work together and form groups and then there would be raids on zombies and other groups.

We can use a campfire, not so much as to ward off zombies but why not use it to draw zombies in that direction. So lets say you are out at night and need to get into a safe house, save a person or go somewhere that has a ton of zombies surrounding that area, creating a ""fire"", explosion or something of that nature would draw the zombies in that direction. Now with our ability to climb and move about freely, we are able to escape and get to said destination. Would that make more sense in the use of a fire at night? And yes, I realize a single gunshot would have a similar effect but I am also looking at adding different elements to the game. If one doesn't have a gun but wants to create a distraction, there would be other ways to do so.

That is YOUR hangup. Fact of the matter is, after 2016 your consoles will lose all support from gaming companies across the map. Why, because it is business. The last gen consoles had their run. You people that seem to fixate on this notion of entitlement to everything is baffling. You obviously have no knowledge of how business runs. If you hate Techland so much, then why bother coming to their forums just to whine? I'm tired of seeing people complain so damn much instead of taking the time to actually understand the situation. To stop an educate yourself on the ins and outs of how business is run. A console's lifespan is 9-10 years at best and this is the last year Xbox 360/PS3 will ever have their fill. Face facts pal, either you upgrade and quit whining or be left in the dark with your old and obsolete games.

"1315","I have done a ton of research on Dying Light. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME, but.... There is one thing missing. SPLIT SCREENNow, I did read why they didn't put it in there, but it doesn't make a lick of sense to me. They've tried it out and it didn't feel as real and they want it to be as realistic as possible, blah, blah, blah, etc. etc.Why would you guys take such a lovely game and such a lovely genre, and not give us the option? If the graphics were fine and everything worked out perfectly, why not let us choose whether or not we want to play split screen?I watched one interview on Youtube, which extremely disgusted me. LINK HERE: If you skip to 1:04, the guy being interviewed clearly states there won't be split screen, but you can use LOCAL LAN.Now, what this means to me: You have to buy 2 xbox ones, 2 dying light games, 2 tvs, and 2 subcriptions to xbox live or you can't play with your loved ones at home. DEAL BREAKER!!!I do know that this game has online co-op, which is pretty sick to me, but i don't play online much even though i have xbox live. i usually just use it to access netflix, hulu plus, and the occasional Call of Duty match. What i was looking forward to, most and foremost, was split screen campaign with my girlfriend and/or friends when they come and hang out. That's always been my number one reason to buy a video game. No split screen, no game for me. I didn't buy dragon age because of it, and i won't buy this one unless it's been announced otherwise. I mean, it's kind of rude and cruel to just be like, oh we didn't like it so you guys don't get the chance to decide or even get to see some gameplay.If you look at youtube comments, facebook, twitter, etc... you will notice how many people would love to have splitscreen, most of them saying they won't even buy it unless it has split screen feature. No one is saying they wouldn't buy it if it had split screen. so what is the point in not having it, ESPECIALLY if it doesn't interfere with the game mechanics? Thank you","Feature requests",670

The company cares about their product. Whether you like it or not, in the end the devs were thinking of their consumers when they made the decision. Not every game needs split-screen. Split-screen is not life. This is a single player oriented game with an online component. If it not having split-screen is such a deal breaker to you, then get off of their forums and go buy another game instead of pointlessly bashing the company and coming off as a whining child. Yes, would it be cool for those who live with their families to have split-screen? Yeah, but it isn't happening.

"1347","Look, I know you people want split-screen and I am sorry that you're not getting it, want split screen, go play Wii U. The company cares about their product. Whether you like it or not, in the end the devs were thinking of their consumers when they made the decision. Not every game needs split-screen. Split-screen is not life. This is a single player oriented game with an online component. If it not having split-screen is such a deal breaker to you, then get off of their forums and go buy another game instead of pointlessly bashing the company and coming off as a whining child. Yes, would it be cool for those who live with their families to have split-screen? Yeah, but it isn't happening. You may not understand it, but devs sometimes have to make decisions that will not appeal to the consumer base. The more you understand that, the better.For one, don't tell me what to do. For two: the devs for this game were absolutely not thinking of the consumers when they made the decision to take it out. If you watch the video i posted (which, seeing as how you're arguing with me about it, you probably didn't) then you would see that he clearly said they want us to spend 1600 dollars+ just to play local lan at home. that's complete and utter bullshit. idc what anyone says. they are money hungry chupacabra and i'll say whatever the chupacabra i want about whoever the chupacabra i want. like you. you're obviously a complete know-it-all douche bag who doesn't have enough intellect to look up why they actually took it out of the game.

Thank you, and have a fantastic day  Okay, let me start out by saying I wasn't telling you what to do. I was merely giving you a suggestion. The reason for my post wasn't to be a ""know-it-all douchebag"" as you claim, it was to finally get you people to realize that such a matter is NOT going to happen. I don't care if you say what you want. That was never an issue. I really think most of you on this forum are nothing but butthurt children who can't even talk in a civilized manner. Nobody was arguing with you. Point is, all I have seen from you people is whining about this, b****ing about that. So it had nothing to do with graphics. Still proves my point that you aren't going to get it. It's funny how when someone like me says something so harmless, that I get a reaction and rise out of you so easily. You people get so filled with rage that you act like you have to be a keyboard warrior. I may at one time look like a douchebag, but I would rather look like a douchebag than an easily manipulated idiot. Difference between you and me? I don't get all butthurt just because one little meaningless thing isn't added. I also don't attack someone for no reason other than the simple fact that I am just a pathetic over-sensitive tool. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to keep this forum respectful.  You should really work on that while you sit in wait for your precious split-screen to never come around.   P.S. You mentioned something about graphics as if I stated it in my previous comment, I actually re-read my comment and nowhere did I mention anything that they stated any reason behind why they took it out and didn't add it. Best you read the comment thoroughly in its entirety next time.Edited January 16, 2015 by AoW_Dark_Knight","Feature requests",705

Maybe most play testers may have turned it off so they decided to cut it. Maybe they couldn't find a good way to incorporate it with coop chat thinking people want to talk without needing to whisper. Maybe they cut it because they just didn't have the time. There's always other ways to distract Zombies.Edited January 20, 2015 by BeyondSpectrality","Feature requests",747

Random Side Events or Side Quests to alter the result of the mission, become Ally or Hostile.

Constructing Towers, Traps, Defensive Structures at your safe zone.2. Selection of Zombies model, skills.3. Communication commands feature like : Go left, help, I'm here, Look ! airdrops etc.4.

A great awesome zombie game MUST have a survival mode!  If it's not already in the game,please,do consider implementing such a game mode for later patch?A survival mode will guarantee replayability for Dying Light. Not only that,as survival modes require team mates to fight off the zombies,meaning players will have to get their friends to buy the game = more sales = more profit for you guys.  Thank me later hehe.

"1408","Lol a Beetamon Launcher as a Range weapon with Rapid Fire Modifcation and it uses a Metal Pallets. That be sooo Sweet to see in the Game. x3 Anyone else thinks so o.o?","Feature requests",763
"1409","I think it would be cool if that, when the sun goes down u can actually find a empty building,barricade it up( with like planks u find or make) and possibly sleep out the night, or tough it out and hide all night lol. Or actually camp with barricades and fend off raging zombies at night. Is this possible? Because i hope it is!! As far as I know you can only sleep in a safe house, exchange loot,buy stuff, and be safe.","Feature requests",764
"1410","Here is my suggestion for more endgame content which I feel would really help bring the replayability to a new level. I would suggest a pvpve map where two teams of 4x survivors are competing against each other to achieve parallel objectives. There would be infected everywhere, in the way and making it much more difficult than just running through the map. At certain key areas of checkpoint's I would imagine traps could be set or items interacted with which would either open the next area but open a considerable quantity of enemies, or perhaps even be used against the competing team. Each objective on the map could be a series of events, linear or random and include things such as clearing a safehouse, defeating certain enemies within an area, or holding an area vs enemies for a given length of time.  Player vs player damage wouldn't have to be enabled but could be an option. The ultimate objective could perhaps be a weapons drop, or unique items.  I hope that made some sense, in a nut shell something where differing teams don't have to fight per se but could instead compete directly for something. Similar to the system in place whee you compete against other npc for antizen, but instead vs players!  Option #2 which would be far simpler, have an air drop scenario with 3x drops in total and two teams competing for them, player vs player damage is enabled and it required a total of 3x minutes holding the containers to successfully break their lock and open them. The winner is the first team to reach two completed drops. ","Feature requests",765
"1411","Sounds like fun. I had a similar idea, but more like 4v4 race to air drop then bring to your home safe house. On top of that one or two night hunters join. Each one assigned to kill one of the teams.  So in essence, a 4v4v2 maybe;) Edited January 23, 2015 by seanconnery","Feature requests",766
"1412","CO-OP content  I think you should take into consideration that on co-op you should be able to find a base with your friends and build up you base by scavenging all of you parts and be able to upgrade your base i think this will be a pretty good option in this game and make it 10x more enjoyable in my case as this is what i have been talking about with a few friends. I have also heard and seen that a few gamers want this as well and seeming you have delayed the release of dying light which we all understand the reason for you want to make it as best and worth our while but you could implement this in dying light as it is still being edited.   ","Feature requests",767

"1419","What in the world does The Last Of Us have in originality over Dying Light? A little girl you have to hand hold through the entire game as the narrative makes a bunch of emotional decisions that you have no control over? Only three types of infected and no special super zombie? I have played TLOU three times and I love the game, but saying a game you haven't played yet doesn't stand up to its level is ridiculous. This game, from what we've seen has everything from TLOU and MUCH more. It may not have a little girl you have to take across the country to save the world, but it does look like it's going to have a MUCH more engaging story than Dead Island. Not to mention you can play the ENTIRE narrative with up to four friends.  If you want that super special night zombie it's the player controlled Invasion Zombie. All I'm saying is don't judge the game before its out. - Also if they add a Hardcore Mode don't take the fun away. No grappling hook or head jumping zombies? That sounds ridiculous. Why would you want to take away features from the game?  My dream for a Hardcore Mode:Make it so you have to collect and use Antizin to suppress the infection (not sure narratively how often you're supposed to take it). Add a food meter, add a water meter, add a rest meter, make everything more damaging, and make night last equal time to day. I do like the idea of a limited HUD and Mini Map though.

What Dying Light comes down to is just killing zombies which is fun, but that's really it. In Dying Light you can rush zombies and run no prob even at night, in TLOU there was a sense of vulnerability which made me think. Crafting in TLOU made sense, and everything was more realistic. TLOU was tense and scares were plenty, Dying Light will be an easy action-oriented game where you will go about stress free.

I'm psyched for Dying Light, I loved Dead Island but ever since I played TLOU I realized how dumb Dead Island gameplay is even though it is so fun. Dying Light is shaping up to look a lot like Dead Island which is not necessarily a bad thing but not great either.  I advise the developers to scrap dead island altogether, go back and research to gain inspiration and work the zombie action survival horror game from scratch for their next installment if they really want the hype and success they so desire.

The most annoying thing was how you found NO supplies. Other than that just don't get seen and it's not that bad. It is definitely going to be the better narrative and is more horror centric than Dying Light. But I will personally probably like Dying Light more because of co-op and fun. If I want Stealth I'll go play Metal Gear Solid.

Different mechanics, modes, story, setting, online features, of line, features etc..Just because a game has crafting and another does does not make them similar, or just cause one is melee and the other is does not either. All the variables must be accounted for. Either way, I believe dying light will be better, in coop (duh), movement, crafting (as in tons of it), PvP (again of course lol), melee fighting, possibly even ahooting, and possibly even horror due to the view.

"1432","I think possibilities for the game that wouldnt bee too much of a stretch might include: Rare drops of explosives .. maybe  a grenage or 2 , an RPG possible .. of course you could limit these to scores made in impossible boss battles/levels like the tunnels/sewers with areas with low survival rates and making them rare drops , but it should be possible.You might have special events like military incursions. Special maps where coop teams could battle. Scavenger hunts for antizen on timer (need a dose a day to keep the zombie infection away etc) Expand the world - gate points to load the next map possible or just make the existing world larger / more accessable are all possibilities ; boats maybe to sail to other places.. Have the Dev enter games with invasion enabled and drop nice things if they can kill the 'tank' or other special zombie .. dev could even lead a 'horde' against coop teams etc. Hope thats food for thought !B","Feature requests",787
"1433","What about:  A game mode where you have two teams: For example bandits and survivors. In each match, your objective is to get to the airdrops and capture them. There could be hunger as well, so people need to scavenge for food.  You can use different tactics to take out the enemy team; you can set traps and wait at a corner for them, you can just rush and try to kill them,  or just run to the objective as soon as possible. There are no map limitations, so we can move anywhere we want in the map. We have to look for weapons, food, water, medics for the team. You can also use the zombies as  an advantage to make the enemy slower.  Yeah, and a hunger bar wouldn't be bad at all. (There could also be a realism mode-- the same as this one, but with more health damage, HUD removed, etc.)  I wish you could do something like that !  P.S     I know that this game isn't supposed to be a survival game like DayZ or H1Z1, so I think the Hunger Bar wouldn't be necessary in this game. On the contrary, it could ruin the game  So forget about the hunger bar thingy ! Edited January 26, 2015 by Dreamer","Feature requests",788

These don't have to be all at once. I know this is a business and I would expect you guys to spread some of this stuff among DLC packs. 1.       More Outfits (It just cosmetics but goes along way with the limited customization that we have)2.       More Blueprints for weapons (Maybe let the community decide what types of weapons we want to see that are not in the game)3.       New Uncommon Infected: One Idea I had was a Charging tank zombie. Think of an infected juggernaut with an insane amount of HP. Game Modes (Coop 2-4 players required)1.       Secure The Safe House: Like the title states, a randomly placed safe house on the map that a team of survivors have to secure.a.      Timed 10-15mins??b.      Day/Night Cycle optionsc.      Empty inventory options???d.      Random Boss Zombie in the safe house (Again Crazy HP) 2.       Freedom Runners (Parkour Racing): Now I know this is in the game but a dedicated mode could for it could be awesome.a.      Standard Mode (Racing from Point A to Point B, the first one wins)b.      The Collector (survivor has an item in a specific location, collect item return it to the survivor first to win)These items can be in various places like crate, trash bin, water etc... (Give a vicinity and let the player find it)??? 3.       Zombie Hunters: A team of survivors set out on a mission to kill a specific zombie. Divided into two groups a Brecken/Rais.a.      Tower Survivors (Brecken): Uses only melee weaponsb.      The Bandits (Rais): Uses only guns (Zombies HP and Strength doubled)c.       Timed 10-15mins??d.      Day/Night Cycle options 4.       Harran Retrieval: A typical fetch quest for a survivor where everyone has to contribute. This can be regular items or antizin.  a.       2 or more items across the mapb.      Timed missionc.       Items located in zombie packed areas (even in places that must be lock picked)d.      Day/Night Cycle optionse.      Empty inventory optionsf.        Rais guards possibly also looking for said item.

It would be awesome to have some weapon attachments for some extra customizing!  It would awesome to find/make scopes, extended mags, grips, laser/flashlight sights, silencers, and a sling. Sling -- would allow you to click and hold right thumbstick to toggle a quick-aim feature that modern military and servicemen use in real life. Click and hold to un-toggle to holster and return to last equipped melee or empty. I find it weird that both the military rifle and police rifle have literally no attachments, but the police rifle has better iron sights.Perhaps a sight that would allow long distance shooting -- lets say an ACOG. Other sights -- Red Dot, Holographic, Night Vision. Laser/UV-Flashlight  -- For night would be cool Grips -- Perhaps the grip could allow you to snap between your first 3 targets. Silencer -- For when you want to shoot and be undisturbed by pesky passer-by'ers. Im not asking for these perfectly good items to be just lying around. BLUEPRINTS!Let us make the sling from string or some other lengthy material.UV-Flashlight!? Rubber band a purple transparent candy wrapper over the flashlight.Make the sights cracked or dirty!I want my gun to look like it's in a zombie apocalypse! Im just looking at this like it's NOT dead island.

If the Police Rifle is the best AR in the game, then I'm going to keep it. So finding something or making something to improve my efficiency with it would make the game better for me. It would also be awesome if you could also see your friends slung weapons on their character models.Something to make your weapons stand out among the random players or friends you encounter.  P.S.ALSO CROSSBOWS!!!!Edited January 29, 2015 by Sicksicsixx","Feature requests",814

For example if we are in a northern safe zone and need to travel to a southern safe zone we can quick travel instead of having to parkour all the way there.

"1463","First, awesome gameI would appreciate it when zombies wont appear out of nowwhere. I killed all zombies in the southeast ( fishers village) I swam on the other side of the lake (lets say 15 meters) and opened a box. I swam back and suddenly 3 zombies were standing there, the same I killed a few minutes ago. Or I collect some lavender herbs, after collecting it, I move some meters away from it and when I return to that point where I collected one is suddenly a new one. 1.) So, would it be possible that killed zombies stay dead, at least for 1-2 days? I dpnt have a problem that other zombies come to that place but not the some I killed 5 minutes ago. 2.) You might saw in a couple of treads that there is a bug that it can happen that you lose all your skill levels and items? 3.) I had a night hunter in my save house. Before I found him, I closed the door so I had a ""special guest on the second floor while I was hiding on the first floor... After scaring me for a while he walked through the walls out of the place.  4.) A new mode would be nice. Something like Kill All Zombies, meaning that dead zombies wont be replaced, so that you can reconquer the city step by step. BTW, I thought the map was bigger... The other side of the sea looks amazing, espexially the stadion... I googled that it wouldnt make sence to spend the time to swim to the other side. 5.) Have you considered a new pre-order bonus? I dont care that everyone get the be a zombie mode, I wanted to buy that game anyway but I only pre-ordered it to get the zombie-mode. And many are not happy just to get 6 weapon dockets. I would appreciate if you could rethink about giving another COOL bonus for those who preordered the game, cause the be a zombie mode was the only reason why I (and may others) pre-ordered that game. Last but not least.

I truly am. These are TERRIBLE ideas. Whats the point of having a zombie killing game if you just KILL ALL THE ZOMBIES!?The zombie population is based of the population of the whole world (not in Harran apparently) but you get the gist.When you clear an area, you dont have to re-clear it. That's one of the reasons why they added parkour. You can jump over there, climb walls where there aren't any zombies, or you can just use the grappling hook. No one said you had to kill them all. There will always be 1 zombie remaining to spread the virus to some unsuspecting, ignorant, idiot. Think of that as the reason why they keep coming back.As for loot chests and vehicles. I really don't have problem with them resetting. Their there so you have the opportunity to collect items used for crafting. That's like telling WoW Devs to allow you to mine only one vein of a certain resource, or being able to pick just one flower for a super hard recipe.They reset the chests and cars so you can farm or gather resources over time to keep creating what ever blueprints you want to make.Taking that away would severely limit the players ability to create useful items such as molotove cocktails and healing kits.All those awesome weapon mods that allow you to set enemies on fire, or make the bleed, or electrocute them would all disappear or hardly be used by a normal player due to time limits in which they have to play.

"1480","First off I just have to say I'm loving this game so far. The sense of fear and urgency when you're outside of a safe zone or when nighttime comes, is amazing. Now on to a future idea... This was probably already covered or brought up but I think it need's to be said again. There should be an option to save Co-op story progression. A friend and I played last night for 3-4 (roughly) hours after we both finished the prologue. I sent him a invite to continue the game since we were both at the same spot and after doing a few story missions, side missions, and exploring we called it quits for the night. My friend went to check on his progress and he was at 0% while I'm at 8%. I understand if the reason is so that people can't join other's campaigns who are further and it autosaves you to where they are, but, there should be an option for that. Allow the game to save story progression for all those who are at the same point in the game and if someone decides to leave while the other continues, don't allow the person that left to join their campaign until they've caught up, but still allow the player that went ahead too join the one that left so they could help them catch up to the same point. Otherwise, playing for hours at a time just so that 2-3 other players have to redo everything they just did just so the campaign get's complete seem's like a waste of time. I hope you guy's can work this into a patch quickly. Thanks! ","Feature requests",835

"1482","Hello, I would really love to see a patch come out for this game, allowing you to reset your skill trees.  I am sure there are a lot of people that have put points into things that they regret and would like to fix it.  It could be a money or survivor point penalty or free would just be nice too. I'm sure there is probably some sort of politically correct zealots that would not allow this, but I really think they should have zombie kids in the world, it seems so odd to me that no kid anywhere ever in the zombie apocalypse has died/turned.  I know there are plenty of games out there that have done this and have not been shunned out of existence I don't think. Anyways... resetting of skill tree is my MAIN request!!    Edited January 29, 2015 by PapaTango78","Feature requests",837

"1485","Dear dev men.  For future DLC I would like to see a competitive mode between two different teams, similar to your current co-op competitive challenges but 4v4. The aim will be the first to achieve the objectives but with direct combat between the teams not enabled, ie you can't kill the other team but you can see them. These challenges would need to be harder and require an average of 7 minutes to complete to give the full ""multi-player"" experience. The background blurb behind it could easily be ""we need to get to this before the other faction does"" Egs could be - Recover 3x supply drops. Wipe out 100 zombiesEliminate certain NPCs (20 total, first to kill 10) Who can do the most damage to a superboss/bossesand so on. Edited January 30, 2015 by Airsickhydra","Feature requests",840

"1487","I haven't read any of the other suggestions yet, so if someone else already said this then forgive me. But when I beat the story, and I had returned to the tower, it occurred to me that it would be awesome if I could make upgrades to the tower and upgrade aspects of the tower and really feel like I am helping the runners. It would be cool to also set traps, not only have them preset. I think a lot of these suggestions can be fulfilled by radiant quests, or quests you can repeat over and over again with the circumstances changed a bit each time. The rewards can be anything from weapon mods, weapons, crafting supplies, to simply cash. Another idea for radiant quests would be to actually go and talk to certain people at the tower, or the university(for the other map) and have the quarter master be able to give you small missions to rescue someone, or go to a certain area on the map and find supplies, ect...small things like that to immerse you in the role of being a survivor and pulling your weight. Because these side missions are all fine and everything but I personally have never felt satisfied doing side missions for any game. Side missions are mostly scripted scenarios that just feel disingenuous to the environment im in. And one they're done, they're done.  Okay another thing would be to have a slightly bigger emphasis on loot. After about an hour of gameplay any player has pretty much looted everything there is to loot. So basically it would be nice to have more of the kind of loot in the ""valuables"" area. Things like coffee and cigarettes, but more variety of things, with varied prices. This is all to keep the game feel fresh, and to make you feel like you are really scavenging for a more variety of things...not just cigarettes and coffee, with the occasional jewelry pouch. What? People in the zombie apocalypse only want to smoke, drink coffee,  and flash their bling? Lol. After all that is said, basically the main suggestion is to add some things that immerse the player (me) in the role that I feel the game wants me to be in. Because once you beat the game and do a good amount of side quests the game starts to lose its flavor. Which Is true for any game, but I think with a few added features it can definitely prolong that unique flavor to the game.  Sorry for my poor grammar, im typing this on my phone haha","Feature requests",842
"1488","I'm not quite sure where this should go, but here's a feature request I absolutely know is possible. Previously to this morning's patch, it was possible for users to edit certain aspects of game behaviour by editing files and placing them in the ""out"" directory under my documents. Things like making lockpicking more or less difficult, increasing/reducing skill requirements, letting you check your timepiece at any time, graphical enhancements removing film grain and the like. Players could also edit the length of the day night cycle, ammo counts, shop tier lists, (allowing them to access, for example, firearms earlier). It added a great deal of customization to the game. As of this morning's patch, none of those modifications work. As a feature request, I'd be ecstatic if you reenabled the option to modify the game's content - modding, even minorly, has ever resulting in a game being more popular and more profitable. I've told friends about dying light, and I included ""It's moddable"" as one of the major reasons to play. If you are concerned about cheating on the PC, it's simpler and easier to do so with memory hacking, not script changing. I'd be very pleased to see the option to make one's own changes return. ","Feature requests",843

This is important    My CPU has 4 cores and only my 1st core in being used 100% by the game ..rest of the cores are basically at 20-30 %....Basically u need to fix multithreading. 3) Stamina Bar Depletion Rate.....     30 hours into the game and i still feel like my stamina bar depletes too quickly.....The stamina bar depletes  after only 2-3 swings from a light weapon..You can only get one hit kills if u find a purple or a yellow weapon(with same rank level as your character +/-1)  but that is not  possible in many cases... With normal, or even blue weapons you need 3+ swings to kill a basic zombie but in most cases within 3 swings your stamina runs out so u need to back off which gets annoying.  Compared to Dead Island  in Dying Light I felt that Your Attacks had more weight behind them Meaning You are actually bashing that zombie in the face..whereas in dead island it just felt like small whacks..This was really fun but that fun is taken away too quickly because your stamina bar depletes too quickly..(Shadow or Mordor is a good example here )If only the stamina bar depleted at a much slower rate im sure the gameplay would become more amazing..Imagine You relentlessly bashing a zombie without worrying over stamina and after 4-5 hitts You eventually deal a massive Slo-moCritical to finish him off.. now that would be a good feeling..thats what needs to be changed The Three things i noted above are very Improtant And implementing them will Drastically Change the Gameplay Experience(In a good way offcourse)","Feature requests",851

"1500"," (Please ignore my poor English) Hello Techland team, Here are some of my missing features for Dying Light.I think/hope these wont take long to implement and could make the gameplay much more intense/enjoyable. The possibility to deactivate some ore even all HUD functions like the map in the â€œgame menu under a new option (advanced)â€.Also in the â€œgame menu under a new option (map/enemies/advanced)â€ the function to disable the indicator of the view distance and position of the â€œnight hunterâ€ and the â€œother zombiesâ€ which normally can be seen on the map. These implementations would make the gameplay much more dramatic, because you actually now need to really listen to the sounds which each zombie make to know if they see/hear/chase you. The possibility to set a spawn/respawn point at every â€œpersonal bag (the bags in the save zones where you can change your outfits and storage some items)â€. This would be very useful because probably many people me included don't like the spawn system at the moment, I don't want to spawn somewhere at the end of the map because there is a mission which I already started or an outpost which I just have taken over. I want to spawn somewhere where I think is the best position to start the game and move to a spot/mission. There is a â€œnew game +â€ but with no really new features except that you can keep on leveling with the equipment of the older save game or? Sorry If I am mistaking.I think it would be a great idea to implement something which makes the game more intense at the difficulty side. Maybe something like â€œnew game ++â€ or â€œhardcore â€¦â€? Where the zombies are much harder to kill (more live), can see you from a much wider areal, don't stop that fast to chase you, move a bit faster on day/night time and maybe even on day time the â€œnormal zombiesâ€ can turn into this â€œrageâ€ where they turn into the â€œrunner type of zombieâ€ but only if you lead their attention to long at you and done some damage to them (this would make every normal zombie to a potential thread and if you attack one you need to kill him in time or he will turn at some time and chase you. This would add the more intense gameplay for the more â€œhardcore gamerâ€ and people which are looking for a more challenging gameplay experience. These are  all wish features for the moment, there will follow some more if I played enough and have more experience with the game (waiting for performance patches etc.)I hope not alle of my points are already listed somewhere else.  Greetings from GermanyEdited January 30, 2015 by Imiperal","Feature requests",855

"1508","Couple of suggestions to inprove the game imo:  before I beggin I should say that this all could be  accomplished by introducing dificulty levels, (normal, hard, brutal and stuff). Didn't read all of the other users suggestions. 1. Number one and most imporant ,  increase dificulty of Volatiles by this I mean run speed, pounce distance, damage, detection area and detection speed. I'm lvl 14 average on the 3 skill trees and I find the game very easy when it comes to escape or kill volatiles, throw a couple of flares or  UV lantern on theyr face with a good weapon and they'r down.(this again imo would make this game much more fun and scary to play at night) 2. Increase overall dificulty of zombies during the night(just a little bit). 3. Implement a coop invasion mode where more than one player can enter a another player's game with litle or no warning and control a volatile. I also suggest when we get invaded by a Hunter that more players could control any kind of infected. thats it for now, ;P I'm only at 19% of the game main story. Great game btw, best one in years. If you agree with my opinion just like and share.","Feature requests",863
"1509","     This idea came about from playing with a few simple handicaps I thought would make for a different experience. Turned out to give the entire game a different feel. - No HUD modThis disabled all HUD elements, Absolutely nothing. I enjoyed the clarity of having nothing on the screen, but the main gameplay difference was the exclusion of the mini map. - No musicI thought disabling the music would create a more immersive and tense experience, and it did. The sound of sprinting, screaming infected behind you at night was much more thrilling than chase music. - No survivor senseSurvivor sense allows you to know too much information, disabling this made it so you have to actively search for things, be observant and listen for nightmares. not knowing exactly where they were was great. - Not repairing my meleeAs you reach the end of the game, even if you do the first three things listed above, the game still remains unbalanced. You are able to one hit everything, so nothing feels threatening, and the tension is lost. The best way to keep the tension throughout the game is remove melee damage progression. I chose to not repair my weapon and see how it played out, the damage was a little low (took 5 or 6 hits to kill regular infected with one handed blade, 3 to 4 with two handed), but this simple constraint had a lot of unintended side effects that were very fun to play with. Guns now became a better weapon to use, but you had to deal with what the noise of the weapon causes. The game became focused on running and using your environment to deal with the infected instead of slashing through everything, even just a group of regular infected is something you have to think about dealing with. PROGRESSION These changes cause progression to shift, progression is no longer hitting things less before it is dead. Progression comes from the various abilities you gain and becoming a better runner. Utilities like the grapple, dropkick, stomp, and roll allow you to dispatch infected in a more broad manner. You become more versatile and powerful, but because of the nature of these abilities they do not create imbalance. GUNPLAY With these changes I noticed I used the guns a lot more because they were now comparatively more powerful. I had to make a choice to kill enemies quickly and create problems for me later due to noise, or take them out slowly. THE NIGHT Probably where I had the most fun with these changes, The nightmares are now something that always felt threatening. It was the first time in the game I felt I didn't want to go out at night. Nightmares now never can be beaten with melee, the only way to kill one is being clever, Such as stunning them with UV as they chase you up a wall. Guns work on lone nightmares, but there are usually more than one. Running away is the best option, as it should be.      I hope we can get mod support soon. Just support to allow people to change the values of things that are currently in the game, and let people play co-op with these variable modifications. Disabling changes to game files to prevent cheating is not a smart decision, cheaters are going to cheat. Games that are competitive and have careers related to them have cheaters. All this patch does is remove the ability to change how the game plays. I was looking forward to playing the entire game again with these handicaps. The game works very well mechanically but some balancing issues and design decisions make the gameplay less immersive, less difficult, and less tense than it could be.      I didn't follow the dying light videos much before release, but earlier videos of gameplay show no HUD, minimal survivor sense, and portray the night as something that is supposed to be tense. Not sure why they changed the design so much, The few hours I got to play with these changes before the patch were outstanding and required no extra work by the developers. If mod support is not an option because of rampant cheating in a non competitive game, I propose a gamemode that: -Disables all HUD elements -Disables survivor sense -Disables music -Removes melee damage progression (I don't know how scaling and damage works. For common infected 4 hits to the head with one handed, 2 hits to the head for two handed seems like it would play well.) -Disable quick time events in cut scenes (They don't add anything and I think showing a button prompt in just these specific cases would be a worse decision.) -Should probably be unlocked at the end of the main story because it requires the player to have knowledge of interactions with objects (such as what containers are lootable, what items can be picked up, press keys in certain circumstances.)      These changes make the game feel like what it was originally set out to be and seemingly require very little effort.Edited January 31, 2015 by BillyMays","Feature requests",864

"1522","Hello Techland I must say game is apsolutely amazing! Really enjoying it so far even tho i didn't finished it yet Even tho you are still trying to fix performance for AMD and some NVidia players, i got couple suggestions for future features:1. Give us ability to see watch on our hands (Keybind to turn on/off) so we can watch on hours, easier to check how many times we have left before night/how much time we have before sunrise etc.) and not only 20:57-21:00 :/ That would be rly cool and easy to implement since hand watch animation is already there!2. Grapling Hook is way overpowered i would say. Peoples are just abusing this thingy, i would say nerf it a little bit down.. (cooldown increase or something). Also add damage fall when you hooking from top of building to bottom... no logic.. from top of the building hooing to bottom and i take no fall.. thats why i hate grap.hook -.-3. During Night Huter Invasion, Humans are overpowered. They can 2hit Hunter... also they can SEE where is he.. thats kinda lame(with Survival Sense). My suggestion here is.. to disable Survival sense during invasion! Cause peoples are just pointing UV FL 24/7 and droping 28472389 Flares on the places you are.. not the places you are not. Cause they know where you are!. PLease look up to this. 4. Add more weapons!!!!!!!!!! From 20-25lvl you are getting only few types of weaps (Good Ones) out of 100+ you used to use before.. Just scale dmg from existing weapons  Also please, my biggest feature i would like and i honestly think some of players also would like, to add Bows/Crossbows ))))) Silent kills from a far (Beside throwing knives/axes) - win  To get back to add more weapons, would be nice to add more and more weaps and scale it through lvls you progressing up to max lvl.  5. More Skilsssss and ofcourse increased max lvl heheh 6. WE ALL WANT MORE CONTENT )))))) Game is amazing so far, can't wait to finish the game. But i already want more content. More missions, more and more zombies including maybe new types of zombies etc. Maybe that would be like new ''expansion'' but think about it.. at least check first 5 suggestions and i hope you will get them ingame soon   Cheers, HardstylerEdited January 31, 2015 by Hardstyler","Feature requests",877
"1523"," The game turned out excellent. Thanks to the developers. The truth of the game, there are some not nice things. Some zombies can pass through the wall, by chance, but this is very rare.There is one problem with the hook-cat. When you stand on the roof of a tall building and shoot the hook-cat to the ground, the character flies to the ground and does not receive any damage. It's a bit illogical. I would like you to fix it. I can offer two solutions:1) Make it so that the hook-cat could only shoot straight and up, but not down.2) Make it so that the player could shoot a hook-cat, but he could not be attracted to her aid if the sight is directed below the horizon.P.S. Sorry if there is an error in the text, I do not know English very well. This image and suggestion is a must!","Feature requests",878

"1527","Just have some suggestions for a Dying Light SEQUEL. Since I am not so ignorant and ridiculous as to go start suggesting entire new game mechanics and specific weapons to be patched in to an already released game. For Dying Light 2  1. Remove Weapon breaking. I mean, weapons should still deteriorate and need repairs, but it sucks for weapons to eventually be unusable. Instead of giving a limited number of repairs, how about you make it so that every repair needs more and more materials. Eventually it will be too much to be worth it anyway. But at least it gives a chance of keeping your favorite weapon. Would also stress the need to hunt for supplies. 2. Better gun balancing. Guns should do WAYY more damage, but there should be a SIGNIFICANTLY lower amount of ammo in the world. I hate it when RPGs try to scale guns like melee weapons, so then it takes like 30 shots to kill a single guy. 3. Expanded Customization. It would be cool if each weapon can be upgraded at a specific part,like the handle or the blade. I love having a cool weapon I built up from nothing. Also, maybe add more weapons in each category. For guns, especially, like a hunting rifle, crossbows, revolver maybe. 4. Better Human-Human combat. Please develop the AI system more. There are plenty of detection issues. I don't think there is an actual defined detection system in the game..also, maybe give them some more personality..like actually showing signs of pain. lastly, configure the control scheme to allow a blocking button. It is really needed. 5. Expanded parkour. The parkour system would benefit from Mirror's Edge type moves such as wall running and swinging. 6. Keep the Urban setting. My dream come true would be a vertical based city location. Also, work on making more and more interiors. 7. Moar Zombies. If all else fails, the best way to advertise a new game is MOAR of EVERYTHING. Lol, it actually would be sweet to have even more zombies than there are now. Which is already a lot.  8. Dedicated Stealth system. There should be an actual system for stealth involving humans. Just saying. 9. Hostile survivor system. The world should be strewn with various hostile camps and groups. Not a well equipped army like Rais's men. 10. A renovation system. I like the idea of unlocking new safe zones, but I think that the world should be separated into districts, with each district (in addition to a few small unlock able safe zones) should have one larger survivor camp. Allow things like: Building better fences and barricadesBuilding trapsSecuring the perimeterGathering supplies Cleaning up and renovating camp/interiors, visual improvements. Maybe as your camp grows, more survivors from said district will hole up inside, providing opportunities for trading, defense from volatiles, more supplies, visual improvements, and maybe some followers you can hire. For the sake of keeping it fresh, camps should be able to be overrun if you do not establish good protection.This entire system is inspired from the tower. You do many missions to help the tower, like collecting powerful lights, and getting supplies, but it doesn't really change anything other than giving you a reward.","Feature requests",882
"1528","Hello everyone! I know I'm not popular or a well-known individual, but I've always been interested in games and have devoted a fairly large chunk of my life toward them. From the experience I've gained over the years I would like to propose an ideal that would change dying light, but really drag the character into the survival aspect of the game. Now do take into mind before I go more in-depth that I've only scratched the surface of this ideal, and I haven't taken the time to read everyone else's ideas. For that I apologies, but I still want to share with you my thoughts.In dying light you are thrown into this world, which is ever changing, but isn't your own. You're an outsider thrown into the inside, but like any zombie game you might have even seen when people try and fight zombies they first find a â€œsafeâ€ place to resign. The only issue I have is that everything is given to you. From day one you're thrown into a â€œsafeâ€ tower. Now I'm not saying this is bad, but I feel like the character is lacking. So here's where my proposal come into hand.What if you could select, or even purchase an entire building. Take into consideration; an NPC has a quest, which he has offered you. At the end of the quest the NPC could leave the house he was residing in and leave it empty and barren, for you. The possibilities are endless.My proposal is â€œPlayer created safe housesâ€.Let me underlay some of the idea I have in mind for it.- A new skill tree- Level biased defenses- NPC characters- Walls/Lights/Doors/Barricades- Power- Quests- Customization- Night assault- Expanding- Neglect_______________________________________________________________Skill tree_______________________________________________________________The skill tree would be like the others. As you level up you can unlock Items or new features to be included in your house. This way you have to work your way to good safe haven.( If you really need a skill tree I could provide one at a later date. )_______________________________________________________________Level biased defenses_______________________________________________________________ Basically the way this system would work runs off of your current skill tree level. At level 1 your barricades would be vulnerable because of your in-experience and later along they would improve through training and practice. For instance at level 1 you could only put dinky wooden barricades on a window and block the door with a shelf. Where as the farther along you get you can build more intricate, and well-made defenses.- Is your safe house vulnerable at lower levels?- Do the mobs get stronger the higher my level?- What happens when I max out my safe house defense?_______________________________________________________________NPC characters_______________________________________________________________What safe house isn't complete without NPCs?! I've come up with a couple categories of NPCs that a safe house should have. [Also please see expansion for more information on NPCs]â€¢ Shop KeepThe shop keep would obviously, be the NPC who sets up a shop and would sell items to you when you come by to visit.- Collection quests?- Will there be quest to supply me with special items?- Can they offer me special items?- Will my skill level effect how much they have available?â€¢ Look outThe Look out would keep an eye out during the night to watch the safe house for danger and keep everyone alert through the night. (That is if you chose to stay up and challenge the night.)[see â€œNight assaultâ€ for more info]- Do they spot only infected?- Can they help during the night assault?- What do hey do during the day? (sleep)â€¢ RunnerThe runner would be an NPC, which will leave the safe house during the day and return during the night. Each day he returns he will bring back crafting materials and things he has found on his journey.- How long do you want them out?- Can they die?- Can there be quests to improve their collection rate?â€¢ FollowerThe follower would be a companion NPC that keeps you company on your adventures and will watch your back when you need their help. You can hire them at your safe house after you've reached a certain level. They also level up, but only have one life. (Once they die you must hire a new companion and start again)- Should they follow you at night or leave you?- Are they weak or are they strong?- Can they have custom gear?- Can they carry your stuff?â€¢ GuardsObviously these are the lifeline of your safe house and they keep everyone alive. Without them surely everyone would get eaten. These NPCs protect your safe house during the night and day from any unwanted visitors- Is there a limit to how many of them I can have?- What weapons do they carry?- Do their weapons improve with my skill tree?- Can I upgrade them?- Do they take shifts and switch out with one another?- Do they also level up and become stronger through fighting?_______________________________________________________________The defenses_______________________________________________________________The game will have a list of certain defenses the character can build and create to block and prevent their own demise.â€¢ Window barricadesâ€¢ Barbed wireâ€¢ Barricadesâ€¢ Wallsâ€¢ Doorsâ€¢ Lightingâ€¢ TrapsEach of these will be dependent once again on how far along the skill level of the player is._______________________________________________________________Power grid_______________________________________________________________It seems iffy, but the player should be limited to the amounts of traps and defenses they can have placed based on how strong the defensive item is.â€¢ Lightsâ€¢ Electrical trapsâ€¢ EctEach portion of the house should use some of the houses electricity, and just like in real life if you use too much of it... it goes off. So to add strategy the houses defenses should be limited to some extent at least.The gauge itself should increase either through main quests, or from the skill tree itself._______________________________________________________________Quests_______________________________________________________________The questing system will provide the player with rare materials required to build and level up their safe house. (Until the character unlocks first NPC all quest requests will be done via radio.) There are a couple quests that will fit into this ideally.- Daily questsThese are the repetitive quests to level up and provide the player with materials needed to construct defenses and such.- Special questsThese quests will be required to unlock an NPC in the safe house, either requiring you to recruit a survivor, or save them. Allowing you to be of use of their services, these quests will only be unlocked either at a certain level or if the NPC is unlocked through the skill tree it self.-Are these a one-time quest?-What if my NPC dies?     (You can find and recruit a new one after a certain period of time has past)- Main QuestsMain quests are certain quests, such as to get you started or introduce you to new aspects of you house: Such as the night assaults. These quests will also be unlocked through the progression of the skill tree. Once a certain level has been reached the quest will automatically be prompt._______________________________________________________________Customization_______________________________________________________________This goes in turn with the level up process of your skill itself. The further along you get the better and more badass your safe houses defenses can be.-Can I place my defenses wherever I want?-What are the limits?_______________________________________________________________Night assault_______________________________________________________________Night assault isn't a game mode, but more of an instance that happens over time. From day one the zombies are looking and feeding on any survivor still around. So I thought up an idea. What if you have to defend your safe house, from the zombies themselves? Why build a safe house just to have a new place to rest? Why not, have the option to defend it from and impending zombie threat.Now there are some factors to think about- What If I go to sleep?  You can avoid the night assault for a limited duration, but eventually you will have to partake in it.    - How long do I have before each assault?    - What if I'm sleeping during an assault?You will be woken up from your sleep.    - What If I'm not there?The assault will happen with or without you, biased on a RNG if you're not present (dependent on how many Defenses/Guards/NPCs/Levels you have will affect the odds of winning a battle)Now if you are there, the tide will obviously be turned in your favor    - What if I die?You will be prompted a failure mission, and some of your NPCs will die. OR you will just die (if you have no NPCs) when you awake you will be in the nearest safe house and it will be daybreak. ( A passing by survivor will have saved your sorry butt )- What if I have NPCs?The NPCs will fight to defend the safe house obviously. Their success rate will be determined upon their individual levels. (Guards will be the only ones fighting until there is a breach; at that time the other NPCs will join in the fight with whatever tools they can find)- Can I lose a night assault?Yes. A portion of your NPCs will be killed. (Possibly all of them) at this point when you return your walls will be demolished and your NPCS will be roaming the safe house as new volatile and infected zombies. From this point the player must eliminate them all and restart the electricity to bring the safe house back online.- What if I'm a low level?The lower the level you are the easier it is to finish the night assault.- What if I have UV lights?UV lights will prevent zombies from attack certain areas of your safe house, and limit the breaching points, but altogether the player shouldn't be allowed enough lights to surround their house. (if to many lights are added the power will go out and you will be defenseless)_______________________________________________________________Expanding_______________________________________________________________As you level up, you should be allowed to expand your safe house to accommodate more NPCs and additions. At a certain point the player should be allowed to either expand their safe house into another building or into a courtyard nearby.- What are the limitations?- Where is the safe house?- Can I chose Where I want to expand?- Can I only expand once?_______________________________________________________________Neglect_______________________________________________________________Neglect is as simple as it sounds. Over time if you neglect your NPCs and your safe house, your NPCs will either leave you, get eaten, or just die. Without a fearless leader to guide them through a rough patch, who are they to follow, what are they to do?_______________________________________________________________That just about sums up my proposal, and I want to let you all know I could elaborate and talk about this all day if given the chance, but I don't want to invest to deeply into it. Plus, I'm sure a programmer would just about ready to strangle me If they where forced to go through all of that. LOLAnyways, have a nice day, Thank for the read!","Feature requests",883
"1529","Hey Techland, you probably won't see this but ill post it any way. Possible Idea for game mode?DLC I call it Operation Clean Slate.(feel free to change it to whatever you want if you decide to use it) Basically this is a new game mode or possible new story either way i'd Love to see it in the already amazing game. The basis of this mode would be the GRE start sending in spec ops soldiers to eliminate everything and anyone involved with the incident in Harran.The player will now have more human opponents who are heavily armed and well trained, you could do this as either random occurrences where small squads appear on the map doing a range of things like setting up communication points and tactical bases, executing survivors or killing large groups of zombies. you could ad pop up command posts around the map that the player has to destroy, obviously the Crane will be a target as well now that the GRE no longer need him. New military grade weapons can be added like the MP5, M4A1 Assault rifles and small caliber Sniper Rifles. You could also add silencers that degrade with use, similar to what we saw in metal gear solid 3, Military spec silencers would be more durable but player created silencers may only last a couple of shots. I feel this could add another level of stress for the player to worry about, i feel that the game doesn't currently have enough human players to encounter and it would be really fun using parkour to get around the Trained soldiers to take them out silently. This game mode could go either way as a full story based adventure or just another level of random encounters. Another mode could Be the First Person Shooter mode, basically same as the regular game with more guns, ammo and zombies. The game you have created so far is so immersive and enjoyable, i've clocked 13 hours so far and have only completed 14% of the game, It's a Blast.","Feature requests",884

Example: Military drops that contain weapon attachments, gear, and ammo. Civilian drops that contain various items (substitute flares and med kits with other items that would be useful) This would make getting air drops all the more important  instead of farming them for skill points and thats it. That along with having various attachments throughout the game would make weapon hording all the more fun and worth it.A perfect idea to expand upon others thoughts about weapon attachments and such...if the airdrops contained random gear other than just flares and med kits.

Timing the block reposites the enemy and your weapon takes no damage. A way to reward good players and the decay is there so that you don't rely on it.  YESSS!!!!

"1546","Greetings, all.  I've had an idea or two in my head for Dying Light. 1. A bicycle vehicle - It would pose as a way to get around and you could have 'mounted combat', using one handed weapons. You could also put pegs(or spikes) so that you could ride with a companion if you cannot find another bike. You could limit the bike count to a 1:2 (One bike for every two players) if you felt like nerfing the idea.  With the spikes, you could peddle along, ripping through zombies, maybe even doing some tricks that would slam the spikes or pegs into them. You could also do bike parkour, maybe(Bunny hoppin off of things, wall planting like when you vault against something). Implement friendly races between co-op players. ""Night time? Oh, let me just TURN ON MY FLASHLIGHT MOUNTED TO THE HANDLEBARS!"" YES, a flashlight for your bike, or maybe you could just use your own flashlight/UV flashlight. The streets are too cluttered for motor vehicles, so why not take something that doesn't need any power other than your feet? You could enforce maintenance, or even unlock more customization with the bike. mountain bikes and BMX, depending on the terrain of the area 2.Skateboard - Would be an easy way to get around. Could implement skateboard-based parkour(grinding, wall rides, ollie-ing off of a zombie's face.) You could use the vault style move to bounce off of walls with a wall plant or offf a zombie. 3. Row boat - Because row boating is cool. 4.Deeper outfit customization 5. More guns, maybe? 6. Dual wielding knives or one-handed weapons.  7. A blocking system, perhaps? Like Rais' men do all the time.  I really hope you consider any of my ideas (mostly the bicycle)","Feature requests",901

"1550","Hi, recently finished the game and it was amazing..

Im just hacking and slashing, having great fun and also on an exciting mission where I have to, let's say plant some bombs inside a building.. Everything is running smoothly and i cut a corner and ""BAM"" dead. I died so many times because of just that and it was soooo frustrating.. What i think could have made this ALOT less annoying would be to either:- Make them like a gas tank - Give them an fairly low hp base, give them a couple of hits before the ""ignite"" and then go boom.or- Don't let them ""One-shot"", scale them by the players current HP Pool or something, let's say you have 100 base, scale their explosion to hit for 75 damage. 125 - 100, 150-125 etc.At their current state, as i said..

"1553","Kind of far fetched here but I finished the story and even though I really enjoyed it and just thought of a selective story. A story where the player's decisions could alter it some ways. I really loved the cutscenes but I was thinking about if I could do something during them, instead of watching them. (Even though they were awesome). Maybe the decisions made in the cutscens could alter the story in different ways, like being able to save/kill certain characters, choosing to do things like: stashing the anti zombie pills from that airdrop mission instead of burning them, or possibly even choosing sides between the two factions. Like in Dead Rising 2, there was a main ending and 3 or 4 other endings that could occur based on the player's actions throughout the story.Extremely farfetched but I just thought this might be a cool idea for an update or a dlc.Anyway great game, pretty much loved every part of it!","Feature requests",908
"1554","I had the idea today that the player could use the radio that they already have to ""browse random event quests"" in a way. Basically the radio would become an equipment like the UV flashlight and grappling hook, where you can always get a new one at a quartermaster. You would hold the trigger key, or just press to toggle, and rotate the right analog stick to surf through channels and look for distress calls that lead you to events scattered across the city. You could even have it so that there would be a few methods of scrambling so that you could do a quest or two to get specialized parts and modify your radio to unscramble those messages. That way, you could even listen in on Rais' men and do stuff like set up ambushes, raid their supplies, or lure a horde right to their doorstep. Climbing up higher, not necessarily compared to the whole map, but more compared to the immediate area around you could give you  a boost in your signal, allowing you to hear more clearly and pick up more transmissions. Standing in the streets near buildings, or being inside for instance would be full of static and have limited choices, while climbing on top of a building allows you to hear many more, much more clearly. Maybe climbing a tower and using it could even allow access to really high security missions, some even sent from outside the city.","Feature requests",909

"1561","First off, let me begin by saying: I love this game! This is the first game I've played from Techland, but I'm impressed, it's a lot of fun, and co-op (which I've been mostly playing) is a lot of fun. That being said, I do personally find this game to be very easy. I find that you can get pretty good weapons early on in the game (I think I was ~30-35% before getting 200dmg 1-handers). Nearing the end of the game, I find having a 4x 900+ damage weapons tends to kill the challenge. In 2 player co-op, we'd be able to hunker down on the bridge and survive the night slashing zombies with relative ease (although, it was still a lot of fun!) Now, I haven't yet beat the game, so if any of the following suggestions are available after the completion of the game, my apologies. I would like to see the following feature:- a New Game + mode, with increased difficulty... suggestions are-- take more damage from zombies-- make it take more time to level the character-- reduce the frequency of getting those 'amazing' weapons, and make it more rare for merchants to sell those high-quality weapons  Personally, I think reducing the frequency of high level weapon drops would add more of a survivor feel to the game. Right now, no weapon in my arsenal is 'cherished'. There's little incentive to put weapons away to storage, since by the time your old weapons break, you'll already have found 4 more that are a tier higher. Additionally, co-op, while extremely fun, does tend to make the entire experience very easy, it would be cool to see zombie health scale based on the number of players in the game. Lastly, while I don't think it would appropriate for this game, it would be pretty amazing if future iterations of the game allowed you to specialize your characters more. Give us the ability to choose our own armor, and diversify the types of builds available in the game. For example, I could forego high agility for a character that can wear heavy armor, and have high health, at the penalty of mobility. While other players can focus on agility + stealth builds that take advantage of the free-running in the game. Of course, for this to work, a fast-travel system would need to be in place for those builds that cannot take full advantage of free running, but in my humble opinion, it would be a lot of fun to have a more RPG oriented title than Dying Light. If you take the time to read my comments, thank you. I really enjoy your game, and am recommending it to many of my friends, it's a lot of fun to play. Keep up the good work Devs! I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with in the future. Edited February 2, 2015 by Beegie_B","Feature requests",916

"1564","Hi! Just wanted to suggest that there be a demo or trial version of Dying Light. Tried searching up if someone has asked about this but have only found people asking about the pre-release demo which was definitely a no. A trial version would help to convincing people what Dying Light is about since i'm having a hard explaining what the game is to my friends and the best solution would be for my friends to play it and get a hands on feel. I know that I was convinced to buy this game when I started watching the trailers but I truly fell in love with the game right after I completed the first mission. Just the feeling of clambering up the side of buildings and jumping across roofs away from a volatile was exhilarating! Also the combat mechanics felt nice since it was such a departure from the average zombie game with the super hero main character just mowing down hordes of zombies without breaking a sweat instead of what would realistically happen where caving the zombie's head in requires a few swings of that rotting plank . Since I purchased my copy digitally, it isn't really an option to lug around my Xbox One to each of their places unlike a CD that I could just loan. A demo version would also increase the accessibility of the game to people who aren't quite committed to it and help them decide whether it is for them or not. Based on my own experience and the general internet buzz around Dying Light, it's safe to say that Dying Light has surpassed many people's expectations and a trial version could help them realize this. Thanks for reading!","Feature requests",919

Would love to see a craftable Bow and Arrows with changeable arrow heads for example (Exploding, Poisonous, Armor piercing, Ext.) 2. More Quarantine Zones - By Far my favorite part of the game 3. Horde Mode - like in the mission The Pit and be able to win items for wining 4. Alternate story missions - from another survivors point of view 5. More guns would be nice.

Soundtrack the best!In order for the game was the bomb, thats my ideas and features:1) Please make that the player could look at the clock at any time;2) Do the phrases of player type ""common, chupacabra! I have prepared for you something special"", and start all cutting! ;3) Make more guns and pistols;4) In some safe zones, you can find the point where you can use weapons, thereby night, you can earn almost free;5) Add animals!;6) Why I can't kill other survivors outside of the safe zone??? This is my main grudge against developers!  But in General, everything is super!Take me to the Studio ideological developer!!!  Thank you! Good night....and good luck....","Feature requests",922
"1568","Firstly this is the best game i've played in years. It's taken me back to how I felt when I first played fable, mass effect and goldeneye.  Suggestion for new items and ideasStrobe torch, to temporarily disable humanoids / ie blind. UV flare harness where flares can be carried on the body of a player for a short period. (perhaps limiting speed)Gun customisation, 3x upgrade slots for a scope/sight, silencer and mag. A prestige system with each playthrough completion increasing enemy health by 100%. Max prestige =10? with a new skin for each completion. (personally think thats a great idea) and would give me another couple hundred hours play time. Next, an idea for an endgame mode to keep interest in continued competitive play. 100% lastly, a game mode where player based teams compete for antizin drops, not via directly fighting each other but by racing and fighting off Z's. First team to collect 2/3 Drops, with sub missions to defeat / defend key points in order to unlock each drop. You could always attempt to sabotage the other team by creating noise near them to attract more Zs / trouble.  An alternative to the above could be teams competing to perform the most actions in a given map within a given time span. Simply put a point based system where defeating rais's men, defending survivors, completing small side mission will award points. Rounds could last 7-10 minutes. The starting areas could be a random safehouse each time to keep it varied. ","Feature requests",923

"1570","#1. So far ive seen only medpacks and flares in supply drops. Would be great to see other stuff as well.#2. Mod merging/melding. So far only 3 recepies:a) 3(+1) of same mod upgrades to a mod of same type but higher level, eg 3 champions(+1 random mod of same quality as catalyst) upgrades to 1 king mod. melding of mods; can be performed on 2 types of mods with diffeerent bonuses, and yelds a mod that combines stats of both mods, eg 3 assasins + 3 berserkers = 1 championc) refining mods; 3 random mods combined produce a random mod of quality that equials to quality of mods refined; if mods that are being refined are of different qualities, eg 2 whites and 1 green, then chance to produce white mod is 66% and green mod is 33%. If theres 2 whites and 1 blue, then chances are: 50% for white, 25% for green and 25% for blue(eg each skipped tier counts as additional mod). And so on.#3. Ideas for a couple of skills.Fast pocket - auto-pickup packages that are left when corpse decays when run over them. Skeleton Key(+Locksmith Training +Sensitive Fingers, both increase chances of successful lockpick by 50% of base value, each) - auto lockpicking, chances depend on level of lock(eg initial success chance for easy is 40%, moderate 30%, hard, 20% and very hard 10%) and extra skills(just tap a button in lockpicking screen for action).#4. Maybe its just me, but money spending opportunities in the game are extremely limited. So, instead(or in addition) of 3 skills that give discounts, add 3 skills that increase amount of stuff in the shops and chances for spawning some rare items.#5. Fix vegetarions(eg all types of plants), they constantly spawn below ground(but maybe its just my problem).","Feature requests",925

"1574","[Feedback and Ideas]-Be the zombie (dlc) Hi there my feedback is on the be the zombie, the zombie is in 1 Vs 1 way to easy to take down a guy I have just tried were he slams into the ground all the time and killing me by hitting me, well i could dodge and i am doing so, but when im on the roof then what im dead I don't feel the time for me to jump away and I can't jump sidelens cause i probaly fall out (this problem is mostly only on old town) and when im on the ground if there is something behind you or the way you dogde you just get caught by it, when I Uv him he just slams me away, the only way for me to kill him is when hes all down by UV and hit him once but the he slams me away and i do lose health every time, when im on 35 hp left i have to retreat or give me medkit, the slams is okay, but killing me with it and hitting me is kinda upsurd, the time for to lets say take the flare out and throw it, is where he can get me away from the flare by slam, every tackle he did i dodge, but the slam if he misses me he just doing it again, right before im right next to him.well i will try the combo to see for my self cause if you can't do nothing then its bit sad against 1vs1Dear Dev please take this as a considering to tweak the slam  the damage Next thing is death, when you die as the zombie, you respawn so far away and so slow, that every time I died I lost 1 nest, so 4 death = lost game.I tried one time to spawn away from them and had to catch up with them to get to my nest, but it was too late  So devs, anything on the spawn location or time would be nice. against 2 or more its really difficult since if you die 4-5 times you lost so you have to kill 2 every time, and people do teamwork in this game (some do) and then its pretty hard to kill them even if you spit, they mostly dogde (some of them) or you could hit them wich is perfect but the map they can see me all the time just keep one eye on me and the rest running to nests or 2 on me just UV me and my prounce is gone and i mostly have to use abilities, it could be i was unlucky against those i met, but those who don't know the game to well don't even dogde, and they die.Dear Devs again  maybe tweak the map thing, since its fairly easy to spot 1 hunter. in slums there is not much thing to do as the buildings aint high like old town so hitting 1 time with UV and prounce is gone then the abilities if the missed, you're fucked, and dying against 2+ is more easy that 1. Ideasmy idea would be the zombie gets a little bonus against mutilple enemies like abilities regenerate faster you spawn faster, more resistent against uv or something and by doing that it wont effect if you do a 1vs1 and the bonus only happens when you join 2 or more players, cause the more the better bonus?I hope you guys will read this, sorry if you see spelling mistake I will put this as a topic to hear others opinions ","Feature requests",929

"1583","They say if you make enough noise, eventually you'll be heard.  I and I'm sure many other people who play your game would really appreciate the ability to disable the HUD. Primarily the map because during your second playthrough of the game, you have to admit that the game gets rather easy when you take into account all of the craftable items, skills and not to mention the Survivor Sense which helps locate loot and the Nightmares through walls. The map is an extremely useful tool and I'm afraid that playing with it puts me at an advantage that renders the threat of night to be a mere cakewalk instead of the terrifying change of events that it's claiming to be. All of the dangerous infected appear on the map as white arrows. They turn red when they've discovered you and yellow when they're searching for you.. So, how exactly is that scary to a player if they know their every possible move and exact location?  I play on PS4 so unfortunately, my access to mods is simply fictional. However, if I owned this game for PC, a no map mod would be the only tweak I'd make considering how well crafted the game is. IMO, the Survivor Sense is the perfect mechanic that doesn't make a player immune to challenges but does everything the map can and could do. Give us the option to remove the map/hud guys!  Edited February 3, 2015 by Wolfman","Feature requests",938

"1590","I would absolutely love this game even more if you added a few simple things to the game:1) Add a hardcore mode.         - No HUD     - Only be able to carry 4 weapons ( or less weapons generally)     - Night time cannot be skipped     - No mini map (if no HUD isn't an option)     - Really really tough monsters at night (the kind that are barely able to be killed but are kinda rare to find) That way people will absolutley        not want to go outside at night.     - Player deaths should be punished severely (Example: player loses all his weapons and equipment?)  2) Be able to look at your watch at will. Basically just pressing a key/button and the character brings up his watch. I am constantly checking       the time and opening the in game menu breaks the immersion.  3) Add more creepy and scary noises at night. Perhaps add the mutated children's cries at night. Have them be heard in the distance. Add new noises and cries basically. Thats pretty much it. I just want to say this game is really fun. Love it! I really like what the mutated child.

"1591","Please add harder and stronger and new units that only appear in the game after beating it. I used to be scared of running around at night because volatile's are fast and hunt in packs and can be quit a pain to kill for someone who is new. Unfortunately they are very easy to kill without even using weapons.... All you have to do is stand on a rooftop to where the volatiles all come from one single direction, wait for them to try to jump on the roof and simply kick them when they are in mid air, watch them fall to the ground and die. I mean I just beat the game last night at level 19 in each category, almost level 20. It actually wont take very long at all to reach max level simply utilizing this method. Likewise the volatiles should be smart enough to know they can't walk in water, so they should not be committing suicide trying to kill you. If the one enemy unit in the game that should be feared is extremely easy to kill, that trivializes the rest of the game. Likewise everything else in the game can easily be killed with molitav's and flammable liquids if needed. For a survival semi horror game I do not feel like the game was even difficult to begin with. I think the games difficulty should be increased, or an optional harder difficulty mode should exist. (Maybe add more of the zombie children / babies into the spawning instead of dedicated rooms in some buildings. While they are difficult if they notice you, a grappling hook to their face gives you enough time to one shot them)Edited February 2, 2015 by Jgizle","Feature requests",946

"1594","The beginning hours of the game were mesmerizing. I actually felt as though surviving was a struggle, and that helped create the atmosphere of the game. I had an incredible time with the game until I hit arounde Survivor Rank 15, when the difficulty started it's ridiculous drop. A basic increase in difficulty could help, but I think it was mostly due to weapon scaling and how crazy available oranges and purples are in shops....and how relatively cheap they are. Regardless, I think what would best suit the game is a hardcore mode with a limited HUD (preferably none at all, especially no minimap), hunger/thirst bars that have to be periodically replenished or suffer some major handicap, all-around increased difficulty, more Virals, increased scarcity of supplies....I mean, I could run a hospital with all of these medpacks. Seriously. And dying. The punishment for dying needs to be something that you really don't want happening....possibly a loss of all carried items, including a loss in financial standing and knowledge of skills, even going into the realm of drained skill levels, causing a temporary loss of a skill until enough xp is earned back.","Feature requests",949
"1595","Love the game, but i have a suggestion. I think it would be awesome if you were to implement a scarce resource aspect to the game to give a more intensified sense of the city being in quarantine and shut out from the rest of the world. One idea i have is to  have it so the tower has a diminishing resource supply, in which the player(s) will be required to scavenge through the city and for supplies such as food, clean water, and medicine (instead of only finding a lot of crafting parts, coffee, and cigarettes) to keep the Towers resource supplies from running out. If only to add more of an incentive for players to keep the Towers supplies filled, there can be a consequences for allowing them to run out, such as a lowered max HP or Stamina. Air drops can be more useful also (aside from just gaining survivor experience), by having them appear less frequent and have them contain an ample supply of a resource to last the tower for a short while. I feel this will allow the player(s) to further immerse themselves into the game as their role as a tower runner/scavenger, and at the same time adding a lot more replay value to the game. Thank you for your time and I hope you take my idea into consideration.","Feature requests",950

"1600","Enjoying the game, but there are 3 things that are frustrating as hell that would make the game much better: 1.

I nearly busted my PC when a checkpoint loaded with my character surrounded by riflemen on a map I'm visiting for the first time. For story reasons I had 1 medkit. It took half a dozen reloads before I could figure out what my surroundings were.  3. Ever since level 12, nearly every fight in the street draws virals, even if I just a whack a zombie in the head.

"1604","First I would like to thank you for meeting my expectations and far succeeding them. I have not had this much fun playing a game in forever. However there are a few things that I think could be added to increase the fun for everyone. 1. Multiplayer modes: I'm not sure if this is possible but if there was an way to add game modes that are 4v4 and up this could add hours and hours of gameplay for many people. I know a huge problem would be balancing the weapons and the the players health. However if you made everyone's health and weapons equal then this wouldn't be as much as a problem. There's also the option to make everyone start with the same health and no weapons. So when the game mode starts you have to search for weapons and items to survive. Also as this is a zombie game the zombies should be included in all the listed multiplayer game modes below. Now let's get into the game mode options.-Capture the flag- two teams of 4, set on each side of the map. Try to steal the other teams flag to get the point. First team to a certain point value wins. -King of the hill- as many teams of 4 as possible. There is designated spots on the map which come active at different intervals. When a team controls a zone the gain points and a set interval. After some time has passed the zone deactivates and then another zone becomes active. A team wins with the amount of points reached. -Team Death Match- all out killing match. Set for a certain amount of kills to win. With death from zombies counting negatively for your score. -Free for all- everyone spawns over the map with no items. Having to loot and kill zombies for weapons and items to craft. 2. Increase the difficulty with quarantine zones. The description of these zones say hard, however with one friend it is very easy to clear these zones. If the addition of other types of zombies this could increase the difficulty. 3. Add bow and arrows! This is my favorite recommendation. You already have added some throwing weapons, now add the bow and arrows and crossbows to the mix. No zombie apocalypse is complete with out them. Then it would be nice to add the same affects to the arrows and bows as the throwing weapons. 4. High scores. It would be interesting to tract how many zombie kills there are in the world and where you compare with everyone. Then with the addition of different game modes it would be fun to compete with you friends to have the highest amount of kills. I know there is the statistics page, however this would just me more for the fact to compare easier to friends. 5. Hardcore mode. Where the zombies have higher health, hit harder, and run faster.  All that put aside, I wouldn't care if none of this was inserted into the game. I love the game how it currently is and anything added will just be a cherry on the top. Thanks again for a great game!","Feature requests",959

"1609","I'd suggest you bring more to the multiple player by introducing new characters to play and level up with their own stories. Their tech trees would differ from crane in someways giving them a unique feel. I'd also do the same with zombies. I'd also increase the players in multiplayer games and introduce a lot more gameplay content. Multiplayer is what keeps the game alive for years. Focus on improving the multiplayer experience. Raiding zones with your friends in coop to competition in player vs player. I'd suggest doing human vs human as well as the traditional human vs zombie. Having players fight other humans with zombies in the middle would be a blast. Could have a mode collecting the most airdrops, team death match, capturing zones, etc. People honestly want to play with their friends being a zombie. They don't want to be the same exact thing either. Introducing new zombies to play with and special abilities to take the humans down would really improve the experience. More humans, zombie classes and gamemods for multiplayer is key. And the increase in player numbers as well. ","Feature requests",964
"1610","First off I just want to say how much I am loving this game!  I've gotten 2 of my friends to buy it and we are playing coop as much as we can!  It's immensely fun and has amazing atmosphere! 1) Base Building - Scavenge for construction materials in which to build or even fortify an existing structure (even if there are only designated spots).  I'm not a fan of having to constantly protect a base against zombies as that would get a bit tedious; however, perhaps have events at night where the player(s) could go out to retrieve survivors (which would act as a shop or repair guy, gatherer, etc etc) and when you bring them back to the base then it starts a ""base defense"" 2) A ""Hardcore"" mode with significantly less loot.  Perhaps even to the point normal zombies carry none with little areas available for loot.  Looting could take place against groups of Rais's men or other survivors who have horded it all prior to your character arriving.  Or you'd have to raid areas like the quarantine zones to find loot.  (Right now the loot drops seem just way too abundant) 3) More random events.  Honestly I'm not picky, I'd take about anything, maybe even helping an old lady cross a zombie filled bridge to make it home?  lol 4) An option to remove having to repair equipment.  At one point you have an infinite amount of metal parts basically and repairing then seems to just serve as a bad mechanic not removed from Dead Island (the skill which allows almost unlimited repair attempts already almost negates repairing altogether) Dying Light is insanely fun with relatively few bugs, it's so far been a total blast and I'm talking just spending most of my time killing zombies.  I believe this game has the potential to become the best Zombie game out there to date and perhaps all time!  Base building, more customization, rescuing survivors who then can move into your base, perhaps creating a survivor community?  This game has just so much going for it, more options, more more more!  Please never become a game that takes itself too seriously and starts to subtract from what the player can do!!!  PLEASE JUST KEEP GOING IN THE DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING, this game is already light years ahead of Dead Island and I'm very much excited to see what you have in store with the DLC!  Thank you for reading and keep up the good work!!!  (I'm pushing for everyone I know to buy this game btw, I stand by you and your product, it's really well made and extremely fun!)","Feature requests",965
"1611","I was hoping maybe you could shed some light on the recent online coop issues that Dying Light has been experiencing which does not allow players to play longer than a few minutes at a time without being booted from the game.  I have seen hundreds of inquiries online about this but have not seen any responses from Playstation or Techland acknowledging the issue.  Myself and thousands of other people are waiting for a patch for this problem so I was hoping you could provide an update explaining the issue and when we may expect a patch that would fix the problem completely so people can begin to experience the game to its fullest, as it stands this is a major major issue.  I appreciate your time and any information you may be able to provide concerning this topic. Thank you","Feature requests",966
"1612","I have a suggestion. While i do quite enjoy Dying Light, i found that after you learn mechanics - it becomes less about horrible zombies and more about navigating those mechanics. I'll elaborate. After i discovered that in order to play at night - you just have to watch on the minimap and throw crackers left and right in order to avoid encounters - it became way too easy to survive it. WIth your aoe ""sense everything"" + minimap which not only shows relevant enemies, but also allows you to see their cone of view - there's no challenge or tention at night. Same goes to zombie mode, survivors do not fear you cause they can see you constantly. They are not encouraged to stick together, try to hear the zombie and generaly be on alert. What i'm trying to say is that at some point you realise that game is too gamy and you stop paying attention to it. What i suggest is putting a customizeable interface (which will be forced in coop by the host) with an ability to replace minimap with compass or turning it off completely, configure markers that are avaliable on maps and compass, disable zombies' alert indicators, zombie reaction to flashlight (might be a bit tricky), configuring survivor sense, etc. That won't make game unreasonable, cause your interface's functions are duplicated via other mechanics. I.e. the alert indicator over zombies head is duplicated by the screeching sound it emits when he spots something suspicious. I sort of feel that it will make the game more atmospheric for those who would want it be about zombies and not another loot hoarding, quest doing, zombie slasher. WIth parkour. Sry for poor grammar, tried my best. ","Feature requests",967
"1613","This is less of a feature request and more of a balancing request. In normal gameplay, using a gun has consequences. You make a loud noise and attract Virals but what you're shooting at is taking damaging shots. That's good, it's universally accepted that firearms in a zombie apocalypse should be a last resort thing. However, in Be The Zombie mode. The number of zombies and special infected is severely limited and for good reason. Balancing. The Night Hunter is capable of slaughter and thus, it's no surprise that the devs saw it as a good decision to remove Goons, Bombers, ect. when the invasion is in progress. This had undesirable changes. You see, with little to no special infected, Virals hardly spawn. No Virals, no consequences for using firearms. No consequences for firearms? No reason why you should risk using a melee weapon against the Night Hunter.  The Night Hunter is rightfully stuck at a hard 150 HP. Two hits with a decent melee weapon will kill him. Firearms don't kill insanely fast, but they are strong. I'm a level 27 Night Hunter and I had trouble killing one survivor with a shotgun. No matter what he had the upper hand. I horde summoned spit? He moved to high ground. UV light spit? UV flares. If I ever got close enough to groundpound, shotgun. If I went in for a tackle, shotgun.  It was a close game but the entire time, there was no reason why he should worry about making loud noises.  All I ask is either, Virals should spawn as they do in single player, one to many loud noises and you have to deal with about 4 or 3. Either that or being killed with a firearm drastically reduces the spawn time to the Night Hunter.","Feature requests",968

"1616","Hi I don't know if the devs are still looking for ideas but here are my thoughts. I think it would be cool for there to be a survival mode that is separate from the campaign; a mode where loot dose not re-spawn and there are no safe houses or shops. The player or players could possibly create there own safe zones. To survive you would have to scavenge food or possibly the disaster relief packages from airdrops. Also without re-spawning loot the player would have to move across the map slowly picking each area clean until there was none left before heading to a new area of the map to set up a new safe zone. I feel this mode would be leader board based, recording days and night's survived until the player finally died, either from combat or starvation/dehydration or possibly turning. Upon death the player would lose all progress and would start over at day zero in a random location keeping only their leader board score, all loot would re-spawn as well. Anyways I love Dying Light and hope you guys are going to keep creating content for it. Also thanks for considering what the fans want it is really cool, just wish I would have found this forum earlier.","Feature requests",971

Pimp chupacabra game though.If people want this game to be harder, then I pray they implement a 'hardcore' mode.  If that many safe zones is too easy, then just don't go to the one closest to you, challenge yourself by running alot farther to make this harder on yourself so you enjoy it more.Without any fast travel, this  gets grueling enough after spending a long time doing a tough mission then having to haul your butt clear across the map to get to a sparse safe zone. (which becomes a problem if you don't have an endless amount of time to play) People who want a harder game may not realize that there are plenty of things they can do to make it harder to play by just not using or doing certain things that other less hardcore gamers such as myself NEED AND WANT so that the game is fun for us too (at least until we get better at it over time).  As a moderate gamer, I want easier options sometimes. Not to just pick on you, I don't mean this as an attack, just that it's the last post right now and I see a request to even make less safe areas. 0.0Edited February 4, 2015 by Prodigerl","Feature requests",977

"1624","as I'm playing a couple springs to mind  1) have the fire crackers have a much greater noise range... I'm throwing firecrackers at bandits to try and get the zombie horde to go in and finish them off for me.... The horde being around 6 zombies about 10m away, and they're simply not responding.... Give a larger sound radius! Would be much more useful! 2) noises attract volatiles? Yep I think anywhere between 2 -4.... It would be cool if you could sometimes have 8 - 10 Volatiles chasing you!!  3) perhaps a hard mode? Items are more sparse, greater XP penalties for death?  4) definitely the ability to shove furniture infront of doors and windows to make on the fly 'safe houses' whilst zombies try to bash them in!! That would be cool.. 5) new zombie types? Feral type with hair and fangs maybe? On all fours, crouched, fast... Would stalk you day of night....? 6) escort survivors to safety...? Little kids that you would have to carry on you back, which would slow your movement... You could tell them commands, WAIT HERE or FOLLOW ME...","Feature requests",979
"1625","ok so im the lvl 24 in every skill now and im killing the zombies like if they where made of paper. (I was on the bigest bridge with my friend in the night and we slayed everything on the bridge) 1. one ide is to make like one hardcore mode that will make the zombies harder like they have more health or they take more damage. Or you can make so you cant find weapons that takes 2200 damage 2. and i like the hunger and thirst ide (and i know you said that you will not make hunger and thirst) but for those who whant some thing harder. So maybe put it in the hardcore mode (and i dont think that it will destroy the gameplay) 3. and i dont like the last skill in the power skill tree.

You have a nice system to cut parts of the zombies but with the high damage all zombies are die in one hit... I would like to cut heads, arms, legs and use my others skills! not spam LMB!!!  - Medieval swords, egyptian, katanas and stuff like that has to be very rare items, otherwise breaks immersion. If I open a police van, it is logical to see police weapons and rarely stolen objects such as medieval swords... And a pistol silencer PLEASE! - New steam achievements like kill a number of zombies or something that will be more difficult to get, I like to see ingame achievements to. - Money in this game is broken, like items drops, I have more money and medkits that I can spend... - Zombie attacks in safe houses, it would be really fun to defend houses of a zombie attack. And if you don't defend it you will have to recover it. Also repair houses with items, its a way to use the excess of items in the players inventory. - Air freight it's one of the things that I love of this game, you have to keep in the end game and find another reason to go for it, like unique items, or something that players needs and be harder to get one, like fight with an horde of zombies and the night boxes, more harder too, but with better items. - Keep the challenges quest, I would like to play challenges with my friends. - ""HORDE MODE"" and ""HARDCORE""  MUST BE IN THIS GAME. - An easy one... More players in coop = more zombies and more difficult because if 4 players play together and the game still equal... where is the challenge? yeah that's boring... - We need more pvp and pve modes to play with friends.

"1638","1. Ability to set rules for the game you are playing, as well as make some visual representation of those rules when looking at the list of servers / games you can join. These rules would be actual settings you could set when making the game, not just text that no one has to follow. For example no molotov's could be a setting and as such you can not easily kill goons and zombie hordes in 1 hit. Likewise another setting could be no ""finish""ers, and another could be no executions, meaning no alternative 1 shot cheesing mechanics. 2. Some actual difficulty settings. The base game I would consider ""easy"" difficulty. I went through the entire game without ever using mods on my weapons due to I wanted to wait till I hit max survivor level to mod weapons that I felt wouldn't be a waste. Even then though it was relatively easy to kill the average zombie in 2 swings to the head. After I beat the main story of the game I was able to easily find a double barrel shotgun with over 1k dmg and a katana with a few points dmg away from 1.4k.  3. Bolter's need to be changed. Currently they are a 1 hit kill with essentially anything. I melee them once, shoot them once, w/e they are dead and their tissue is mine. If you are at a high elevation that shooting them poses no risk at all then you have no reason not to take the free kill (and occasionally get way more bolter tissue than you should). For example on the bridge with the lightbulbs you need to remove there is a bolter feeding ground literally below you from the safe house on the bridge. All you have to do is go down 1 level and shoot the bolter then jump off on to a car. I think Bolters should be changed to be a stronger and faster version of the volatiles. By this I mean they have more hp, do more actual dmg, and they move a little faster than you do. This forces you to try to kill them or run away and break lines of site as fast as possible.  4. Goons are really annoying to fight. Not because they are strong, or they have a lot of hp, but because their ground slamming attack can still hurt you even if you are a full jump away from them, or you are behind a wall or 2. Can they be killed with melee, yes. How does it feel? Essentially like you have to use ranged weapons or flammable liquid + molotovs. Instead of a ground slam I wish they simply had other wide arcing attacks that they used more often. Its annoying when you are like 4-5 feet away from a goon and you get knocked down only to get attacked by other zombies when you are down.  5. Medkits to easy to get for free. At the bridge in #3 there is also a spot you can get over 100 medkits in only a few minutes. Once I found that out I never needed medkits ever again and could just use them when ever I wanted. Maybe turn the medkits into a ""rare spawn"" situation so that every single one is not there every single time you die and go back.  6. Add more weapons.... There are no spears, no bows, no cross bows, no sickles, no scythes, no ring swords, no katars, no nunchuku's, no swallows, no tonfa's, or even weapons on chain (maces, just chain, ect). Dagger's, swords, maul, and warhammers / hammers are essentially all teh weapons in the game. Even in modern times following the story something like a scythe (short handle or long), a sickle, or a spear are relatively possible to make. Likewise ring swords could be fashioned by adding spikes of any form to a rounded object like tire rims, or bicycle rims with the spokes taken off. Bows of extremely high quality can and have easily been made today with simple PVC Pipe, it is not out of the question to ask for a bow in game to be made in modern times from something you can find in a time after a zombie apocalypse. The arrows could just be sharpened wooden sticks with notches carved into the ends. This is entirely possible it should be an option. This emphasis on melee combat is probably the most annoying part of this game. Melee should be an alternative option, not the primary option. In a realistic zombie apocalypse people would try to keep their distance from zombies when ever possible, ie melee would be second option not first.   7. Fun Suggestions possible additions in DLC? Repair the tower, build a safe house. Repair the city / fortify the city.  Turning the game to more than a survival game but into a simulator of sorts like Sims with zombies, action, and horror.  You need to gather x resources to repair the tower, gather x resources to build the base of a safe house, x resources to make a door, or you can take pieces from other buildings to fortify your safe house but making those areas easier to be raided by zombies as there would be more ways to get in. You could also infinitely add new cities to the game through DLC's that we could travel to in order to help stabilize those area's for other survivors. Maybe add more skills to the game and raise the max levels of the 3 categories in the process. I can see this game lasting a very very long time with simple additions and updates constantly added.Edited February 5, 2015 by Jgizle","Feature requests",993

New Zombie/Infected/Mutated Infected. Would be interesting if you fellas could incorporate something like Resident Evil's ""Lickers"", also called for ""Lance-tongue"" in the game, mainly due to their extensive long and piercing tongue, and that would also be playable characters, and it also have extreme sharp, deadly claws and can jump long distance. To begin of it won't be a playable, it is something that one should level up to, and after that one, also an other Resident Evil ripoff, an ""Lizard-like mutation that has frog-like abilities, leaps long and far! Same thing there! Leveling up to! Also, they could become a part of the game. And the so called ""Invasion"" when you play as a zombie, shouldn't be only during night-time, just my point of view! 2. Weapons. Besides the already existing weaponry, id'e like to see following:Bows and arrows! Ordinary arrows, exploding and corroding acidic that slowly melt away organic tissue, another type that has an areal affect of instant freezing when it impacts, not only when it hit the ""Infected"", but also when it hits a hard surface, like a brick wall or the pavement on the road, or just simply the ground. And different types of bows please, as like a crossbow! And I would also like to see an wolverine-like type of weapon, surf in and look up ""awe me"" on YouTube to see what I mean... And we also have the Bowie-knife... That's quite aggressive and dangerous. Well... That's about it from me! Really do hope that it is something you guys can implement and work in into the game, or at least make to a future DLC?!? Hoping for the best!  ","Feature requests",994
"1640","GRABBING HOLDING THROWING Don't know if it's already have been said, but I would like more control when grabbing a zombie. There are a lot of spikes but it's a bit to difficult to use them. I really want to hold and drag a zombie to throw them in to the spikes.  Maybe you can do it like the ground headkick(L1) or just give us the ability to hold them en then throw them.  I know you can already do this in a way, but I would like more control of it. I kicked a couple of zombies in the spikes. And a few times I accidently pushed a zombie in to them.I think it's not using its full capacity(or it's my gaming skills)","Feature requests",995

"1643","Hello! First of all, I want to say that I love the game a lot, and find it very immersive and fun to play. However, there are a few points which harm the game, and which wouldn't be difficult to remove, I hope so at least. I would like to request an option in game-menu to remove icons for dangerous zombies (both day and night time) in the mini-map in the right upper corner. As it is now, during the night you can see where the dangerous zombies are, their line of vision, and even which direction they are looking at. It's too simple to navigate by using the minimap, and removes the sense of danger completely. The game already has great sound indicators for different zombies, and for me, when combined with first-person sensing and seeing their silhouettes, is enough to be able to avoid them, but be challenged while doing so. This would also keep that great sense of danger. For the same reason I want to request the possibility to remove the icons in the main screen which show how aware they are. These icons distract too much from surroundings. I hope the community supports this, and that it would be a simple thing to implement in the options menu in a future patch. The night time is a fantastic feature which adds to making this game unique, but its impact disappears because you start focusing on the bright minimap and bright icons, instead of the creepy and scary â€œrealâ€ surroundings. I think that adding these features as an advanced option in the game, would satisfy all kinds of players.","Feature requests",998
"1644","Hi Techland,I haven't been addicted to a game like this for a while.You guys are awesome!There is just one thing what bothers me.When I maxed out all the skills, the xp rewards for each kill or agility maneuver stopped.Could you guys maybe create an unlimited ranking system, so it doesn't feel like we are doing it all for nothing.I'm not asking for new skills, (would be cool though) but if the XP stays, it would be nice.I hope this is not too much to ask.Keep up the great work! Edited February 5, 2015 by dlightxp","Feature requests",999

So, to make exp part of the game still useful even after all skilsl learned, an additional, epic upgrade is added. Its separate from rest of the tree and can only be selected once all regular upgrades has been learned. Can be selected unimited times.Power - adds 1% bonus to weapon damage(but only after damages are fixed, current progression is waaaaay 2 much, maybe halve it), durability and handling, per point of upgrade.Agility - adds 1% bonus to all speeds(movements, searching, climbing, jumping, etc)Survival - adds 1% bonus to all the crafts - more items crafted per stack, have higher damage, longer duration, etc","Feature requests",1000
"1646","Hi, couple of requests: 1. I can see the movement/parkour system is based on Mirrors Edge, which is a good thing. However in Mirrors Edge you were able to jump at a wall and ""scramble"" up it for a couple of seconds, allowing you to grab on ledges. In DL you can't do this and have to be looking directly at the ledge you're trying to get to, which is a bit frustrating. Any change you could include this feature? 2. Sort out the optimisation, please. My PC is a few years old so I wasn't expecting the best performance, but this really needs some work. If Valve can do it, so can you. Otherwise, a very entertaining game, keep up the patches. Thanks","Feature requests",1001

"1649","Here's an idea for the zombies if you're adamant about keeping the survivor sense:Let the Night Hunters cloak. We don't have anything for our up or down arrow keys, so why not add something to that?Cloak would make survivor sense not show you on the minimap or in the player's sight. It should cancel on pounce, however. Also there should be more zombies in the world while the Night Hunter is out, and have the Howl not only echo-locate survivors, but have the loud noise attract the beasts as well. Now with that said, I will agree to everyone who has posted how underpowered the Hunter is. Buff please.","Feature requests",1004
"1650"," My question is where is the tactical shotgun that's in the image of weapon dockets? I also think that there is more weapons here than we are allowed to use in the game. I mean I maxed out all of my skill trees but I only have katanas, medieval long swords, chupacabra sword, and egyptian kopeshes. What happened to all of the blunt weapons? What happened to the knives and cleavers? I hope that Techland really supports this game with more weapon variety and soon. I really am enjoying this game but in my opinion I think Dead Island had cooler weapon concepts. I mean I had a bat that had a saw blade in the very tip with barbed wire and razor blades covering the rest of it. The police baton that was covered with barbed wire and razors. These weapons looked awesome. And what happened to the Tanto? That was my favorite weapon to behead zombies with. I hope Techland is really reading these forums because some of the ideas I sure would like to see be implemented to the game.","Feature requests",1005
"1651","Hardcore mode that limits inventory to only the backpack so you cannot carry around an infinite amount of gear.  Can only carry 4 weapons at a time; that is no weapons in the backpack. Maybe increase starting slots to 8 from 4, since only 8 items could be carried - including med kits and lock picks. This would make scavenging a meaningful activity for the entire game instead of only the first couple of hours.","Feature requests",1006
"1652","Your a hero that RUNS all the time, you should add drinking water as a big part of the game to add some realism to the game... First off I love what you have done.  I would love to see more custom outfits to really allow the player to stand out among friends, also I would love to see common uncommon and rare and unique items, give me a reason to keep looting buildings and car.  If you could add another monster type to attack your friends with that would be cool.  I've owned the game now for a week and I feel like I don't need to rummage for weapons and gear because once you get the military rifle that's as good as it gets.  Also I love how scared I am to fire off my guns.  I'M BIG ON GUNS.  MORE GUNS.  My only complaint is the grappling hook is about the stupidest thing you added to this game.  It almost ruins the game for me to see a player spider man around the would.  It works great for the night hunter but not very realistic for the human player.","Feature requests",1007
"1653","Game is great as is, or was until the latest patch. You should have never patched the weapon duplication bug. Not everyone has the time to grind for hours a day to keep recreating weapons, especially when u have one that is fully moded to your likeing. Alot of us have jobs and just want to have some quick and easy fun. If other players choose not to use it, that is their choice but lets be honest, cheats are fun. this was a big step back.","Feature requests",1008
"1654","Great game!  I would love to have to look for clean water to drink to keep up stamina as I'm running and jumping and climbing and fighting constantly.  Please add more guns.  I love to bash a zombie but shooting them is way better.  I also love how scared I am to fire off rounds you did a good job there.  I would also like to have common uncommon rear and unique weapons and out fits to be found while I'm looting homes and cars.  I feel like I don't need to loot anymore.","Feature requests",1009
"1655","Id really like to see another city the size of Old Town, or Slums. They are good maps but can get worn out quick. Also I think that after the campaign it would make sense for the Air Drops to continue, it would be more to collect because you can collect things pretty fast in this game. Also maybe some more weapons? as well as silencers for guns that have durability and can break while you are using them causing the gun to be loud again. More Outfits would be nice as well. Also like i seen others mention, the ability to build your own safe house with friends and defend them at night that seems really fun. If someone invaded your game they could knock out your safehouse's UV lights momentarily to get at them. But honestly great job with the game, it's been so fun so far, any glitches are minor and funny, and you should really add some more secret areas and loot.","Feature requests",1010
"1656","I welcome you on behalf of the Russian community.First of all I want to thank you for the wonderful game!And there is our ideas:1. More zombie's skins2. More realism in crafting. For example, if a player has a weapon that uses electricity, it would be cool to do ""consumables"" used in this weapon - for example, batteries or small batteries that require replacement to the continued functioning weapons in full force.3. More events during an air discharge of cargo:For example - a couple dozen zombies came to the red smoke or other survivors who want to pick up cargo.4. More skins for player, or arbitrarily worn things - glasses, masks, pants, sneakers5. We believe that the big zombies should be able to reset the player from  machines or other low obstacles.6. After some leveling of player - night becomes boring - mutants is not likely to cause serious harm. We believe that the mutants have become stronger along with the player.Edited February 6, 2015 by echo","Feature requests",1011

"1658","I've just finished the story on my new game plus play-through, one thing I have to say is that Dying Light needs a difficulty boost. With all the high tier end game weapons available, zombies are killed in most cases by one hit.  I'd also like to know, where did those knives that I used during the beginning of the game go?

"1661","I love this game so far, but at a higher survivor rank there isn't many weapons to choose from. I'd like to get more of a variety to kill zombies with. Like in Dead Island you could get every weapon you would want at a high DPS. Also, I'd like to have a few more weapons in such has brass knuckles or spiked knuckles how Dead Island had also. I'd love being able to go full hand-to-hand combat with Rias's men or with the zombies. It would blend so well with all of the techniques you can unlock. If this could happen I would love to be able to use high damaged brass knuckles.

"1670","More weapons variety for max level, I haven't seen a decent one handed axes since I hit mat level!","Feature requests",1025
"1671","The biggest thing that I would like to see is MORE CHOICE with weapons. As the story progresses and your level gets higher, your stores and traders will start to be very specific in what they offer. This also applies to what you find as loot in the game. An example of this is that I find nothing but khopesh's, sacrificial short swords, chupacabra swords, and heavy axes. That's it, and the traders only have these things available for purchase as well. If, as a fully leveled up individual with almost 90 hours into the game already, I'd rather have a cricket bat, or a baseball bat, that option should be available to me. I get that the bladed weapons may seem more effective due to their ability to cleave zombies into small bits at a rapid pace, but my weapon selection is simply not your choice to make! I want to see more high level knives, more high level clubs, more high level wrenches and hammers; in general I want to see more selection. If you want me to keep playing this game for it's (somewhat buggy but) extremely fun free roam mechanics, I need to be able to switch up how I do things. If I find great blueprints that require a baseball bat, and I can find no baseball bat, that is a problem. Full disclosure, I've only played the story up to where you get to Old Town, so if there is like an UBER MALL or something later on that I can find everything in, then there's that, but it doesn't change the fact that this is a noticeable pattern NOW. Other than that, I'm really enjoying the game! My best friend is bugged at survivor level 24, it stopped letting him collect points and he's 300 away, so that kinda sucks, you should fix that.  Keep up with the bug hunts and fun little tweaks and additions, and you got yourself a solid game here! It pulled me away from Bungie's Destiny, and that's no small feat. _KCCO_ ","Feature requests",1026

"1674","Dear Techland, I am very much enjoying myself with your masterpiece... Thank you for taking my money   Now onto my suggestion. I like the dynamic events, if you may... The stranded survivors, the airdrops, etc. But once you get to the end game the airdrops stop and you are left with basically not much. My suggestion is to make zombies a bit more clever and bold in the night so they fight courage to assault a safe zone. The big goons hammering down on the main gate. Few bombers as kamikaze. Volatiles leading the charge and commanding their lesser zombies. With the ranks of the lowest zombies to swarm the zone. All allowed by the power shut down, caused by Rais' thugs (just to sit it well with the story... so volatiles can go rampant without the UV lights.) If the player dies during this siege... the safe zone will, obviously, not be safe anymore. So he goes to capture it again.... This would add some change into the game. Since I have maxed everything I have only few challenges left and not much to do...

"1676","Easter Eggs:  1. MORTAL KOMBAT Easter Egg: Basically, it should be a 1-2 player arcade fighting game machine with playable characters such as Kyle, Brecken, Rais (Main Boss), Jade, Rahim, a Goon, a Viral, and a Night Hunter. Gameplay will be more like MK1 or MK2 because it will not be as detailed as the MK games after the first 2. For the PS4, buttons would be punch (square), kick (triangle), throw (x), block (R1), and circle (quit game). The D-Pad or analog sticks can have the player jump around and move around the screen. Basic Moves:Uppercut (Hammer Uppercut for the Goon)- Down + PunchSweep Kick (Hammer Sweep for the Goon)- Down + KickJump Kick- Jumping up (or even jumping forward or back) and pressing kick. Jump Punch (Jumping Hammer for the Goon)- Jumping up (or even jumping forward or back) and pressing punch.   There are 3 special moves available for each character.Special Move 1- Down, Forward + PunchSpecial Move 2- Down, Forward + KickSpecial Move 3- Down, Back + Punch  Fatalities can be performed by pressing Down, Forward + Throw after the screen says ""Finish Him"". When the Goon is going to be finished, it would slouch down while weakened so all characters would be able to perform their fatalities without having to reach very high on that enemy's face and would avoid bugs/glitches when performing the fatality. Kyle's Fatality- He breaks the opponent's neck and does a curb stomp to the face, crushing the head in the process.Brecken's Fatality- He rips off the enemy's head and spine. (Just like Sub-Zero's fatality.)Jade's Fatality- She uppercuts the opponent, decapitating them in the process. (Just like Johnny Cage's fatality).Rahim's Fatality- He basically does a somersault, decapitating the enemy in the process.Rais's Fatality- He basically rips the opponent's heart out. (Just like Kano and he does remind me of Kano A LOT.)A Night Hunter's Fatality- The same way it would kill other players in ""Be the Zombie"" mode.A Goon's Fatality- It would swing it's hammer horizontally, making the opponent fall to the ground first. Then it would smash it's opponent's face, crushing the head in the process.A Viral's Fatality- It basically eats the victim up, tearing the throat and ripping off the intestines. 2. A ""THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD"" type of arcade shooting game. It would have 2 pistol controllers. It can have 2 players.Edited February 7, 2015 by Nasty_Freak","Feature requests",1031
"1677","For be the zombie mode you need to nerf humans. It makes no sense how a human can know where the Night Hunter is all the time. I've been invaded several times and almost always I never get killed because I know where the hunter is at all times. So the survivor sense is BS especially since the hunter needs to rely on stealth and the element of surprise in order to even get close to the humans. Survivor sense makes the hunter too easy to deal with it takes away what is so scary about the hunter. Any weapon that one hits almost anything can kill a Hunter in one fell swoop and the hunter can't fight a human 1v1 let alone 1v4. The hunter needs more damage and health in order for a fair fight. Also if a human can avoid the hunter's tackle make it so that that the hunter can avoid air assassinations, jump kicks and human tackles. Maybe if they were 2 hunters per game that would make it easier and much more fair but since there aren't humans need to be nerfed. Also the hunter should have UV immunity when feeding that way he doesn't get one kill and the get gang banged by three other humans. Lastly respawn time needs to scale the more humans there are in a game the faster the hunter spawns. The closer the humans get to the last nest the faster the hunter spawns. The excuse for that would be that they are moving closer to his home so he can get to them faster, *Nerf survivor sense so that it doesn't reveal hunter location on mini-map*Make human moves counter-able for the Hunter*Hunter health or damage resist scales with top human's level *Hunter damage increased so that they can actually kill humans without pounce*Protective buff when feeding during pounce*2v4 mode 2 hunters vs 4 humans*Respawn time that scales with party size and amount of nests destroyedEdited February 7, 2015 by BeowulfsWiglaf","Feature requests",1032

"1680","Idea for a new multiplayer (DLC). 6 teams. Each team of 4 players.. 3 teams in each city.. Game mode similar to the cooperative mode, with all that the world offers, but without the missions.. No counting points or deaths without missions, aimless. Free game!. Deliveries are made by airplanes, weapons and rare items.. Teams and/or opposing players will not appear on the map. Increasing the expectation of encountering an opponent group at any team.How to work?You standing alone or in group (team), at the sight of deliveries, will go to the map point. So if you have interest in acquiring new weapons and rare items. As it comes to weapons and rare items, the other teams will also have interest. We automatically points of conflict.Each team can heal companions (as in the cooperative). You'll have to load the team to eliminate the opposing teams.Players just after they die, they will lose the equipped weapons (not the backpack) and an amount of money to be stipulated.These weapons and money will be in the body at the discretion of the survivors opponents plunder or not.What did you think?

The caves just have volatiles and that's it.  Also, new sidequesuts that last long like a campaign or just a new part to the main story to go along with the new map sections.

In ng+ currently I can still one shot kill a biter without a mod on my weapon.  If each successive NG got progressively more difficult, each player could progress to his/her own matched difficulty (exactly like demon/dark souls).  As it stands now, there is no reason to play beyond NG+1, and even in the first NG, the biters are easily slapped aside.  Also with regards to continuing play at max level (25,24,24), weapons other than katana, short sword, and khopesh need to be available. Yes I know there are a couple more like the double bladed axe,BUT of the over 100 base weapon types, nearly 100 of them are non-existent at max level and beyond. ESPECIALLY blunt weapons. There is not a single blunt weapon available at endgame.  So summary: 1) Need each successive NG to scale upward in difficulty of all enemies (preferably smarter ai as well as more hp and damage  2) Most definitely need the weapon variety back at higher levels, after surv15, there are no blunt weapons, no small knife weapons, and many others. After designing 100+ base weapons, please don't limit us to 5 or 6 at endgame level.   Thanks devs for making a tremendously fun game, and thank you for providing a place for gaming community suggestions.

"1699","I really like the ""be a zombie"" mode in your game.  However, I do feel there is one crucial change that could make the game mode significantly better.   I remember when I was younger, my friends and I would play a game in the parking lot.  The game was that one person was a ""monster"" and the others had to collect items hidden throughout the lot while avoiding the ""monster"".   Not knowing where the ""monster"" is, was the driving force behind the fun of the game.  He could pop out at any time from any where.  Forcing us to go for the objective and communicate with each other.  Your game mode ""be the zombie"" reminded me of this parking lot game we use to play but it had one fatal difference.  The humans have a radar that tell them where the hunter is...   This completely changes the feel of the game for the human players, removing a lot of the fear.  Often I have discovered the human players will rush the ""hunter"" using the radar once he is located.  With superior numbers, gear and strategy.  The humans become as lion tamers.  With chairs and whips.  The lion unable to really do anything as long as its location is known.  As it stands now, this mode is little more than a combat mode.  With location revealed, the hunter can't truly hunt.  You can be a very crafty hunter.  Finding a perfect hiding spot from which to stalk the prey that outnumbers you.  However it all becomes irrelevant due to the radar exposure.   My suggestion is of course.. to remove the hunter from the radar.  I feel the hunter should only appear on the radar if it is 1 vs 1.   When the hunter is outnumbered, he should NOT appear on the radar ever. How would this effect the game?  Players would no longer be able to hunt the hunter.  They would be forced into the role of prey as they don't know the location of the hunter.   They would have to play the objectives and work as a team covering each other.  Communication would be important and listening to the hunters howls would let you know which direction you should remain facing.  Ready with your UV light.    Altogether I think it would make the mode more intense and not in a combat way.  Knowing that you could turn a corner to be face to face with the hunter creates a much more intense experience.  You would be a fool to travel alone.  Which is why an exception is made in 1 vs 1.   That would be the only time the hunter shows on the radar to make it more balanced.   When outnumbered, the hunter should be off the radar so the human players use their numbers to defend each other.  NOT hunt down the hunter.  Which if that's what you prefer, change the hunters name to prey then I won't have a problem with it. lol  Thank you for your time.  I tried to word this in a productive fashion.  I am not hating on your game or this mode.  I just feel like this one simple change would dramatically effect the intensity of the mode as well as force players to play their roles as intended.  I appreciate all you do.   ","Feature requests",1054
"1700","I just finished the game and I would love it if the air drops came back.  I think you should add a gun skill tree.  I would also like to see player classes such as Medic class and gunner class something to implement team work.  I also think that your outfit should determine what class you are.  If your in an army outfit you should be able to carry more ammo as an example.","Feature requests",1055

"1702","First off, Bravo! I can say, hands down this is the best game I've played for the next-gen consoles so far.  A few ways to possibly improve Dying Light: Primarily for hi level replay SURVIVOR MODE: Instead of a set amount of inventory slots it needs to be by weight limit. The fact that I now have 300+ lock picks and over 100 med packs makes the game loose that helpless feeling and also takes away from the necessity of scavenging. Limit the amount of items you can carry(excluding blueprints). For instance, instead of being able to carry infinite med packs, make a limit like 5 or 10 at a time. This will also make crafting more relevant. With a weight and carry amount limit the game will become more about survival. Especially when it comes to a high level characters. This would also make you think twice before jumping into a crowd of zombies as would would have to keep in mind you inventory. This may also make it so co-op players don't stray to far from each other in times of need.Flashlight battery life would also fit perfectly in a survivor mode.GEAR: Fix the weapon duplication glitch. But to meet us half way, give us a NPC that can bring weapons back from destruction. I've helped a survivor who fixed my weapons but it seems like it was a one time deal. Since you built the engine for it, put it in the game completely. Just charge the players currency when they want something repaired. Its kinda silly this service isn't offered at the tower. Maybe even make it limited as well. As in you could only get a weapon brought back from destruction 3 times with the original repairs intact. So a weapon with 5 repairs will have 15 but in between each set of 5 repairs you have to take it in and get it properly repaired and it cost money. Make the Pyza Suit an outfit not an item. I used the Pyza Suit and can say that having the ability to use the grappling hook while flying would be way more appealing. What little distances you get to fly from rooftop to rooftop doesn't really justify the use of the item slot. The Pyza suit could also be a skill. More elemental effects on weapons would be nice. I have freeze grenades but no freeze weapons or toxic/poison weapons. GAMEPLAY: Another thing that will extend replay-ability is once you beat the game that the G.R.E. reinstate the air drops in the Slums. The air drops bring a randomness to the game and makes the world seem more alive. Farcry 4 did a great job at extending replay by letting you reset the outpost/safe house's. It would be great if Dying Light had the same option to reset the safe houses back into zombie control. That or an option to go back and replay quest would be great as well. (not sure if that is possible with the games formula?)Adding an option to turn up the Zombies difficulty would be great. Be it that they take more damage or hurt you more. I'm cutting them down like butter out here.  I feel most of these are reasonable and very possible and would make the game have a consistent feel of being a survivor horror experience low or hi level alike.Loving this game, great job guys.Can't wait for Dying Light 2 Here is a little Dying Light Zombie montage I made for ya!  Edited February 9, 2015 by HALFRATS","Feature requests",1057
"1703","I would like to say this is an amazing game, the parkour is very well done and makes the game stand out from the hundreds of other zombie games coming out every month. However there are a few things that started to bother me after I got into the game. Misc: Add a button when pressed that while bring up the watch so you can easily check the time without checking a menu. I know you can just look at the sun or wait for the radio, but in all honesty how many of you look at your watch (or phone, I am still a watch person) throughout the day. I probably check my watch at least once an hour, I usually don't look up at the sun to tell the time it is and wouldn't if I had a perfectly good watch on my wrist. Game play: Add an option to turn off the enemies on your radar, It is a great mechanic when starting the game but after a while it makes night terribly easy to survive. I don't think I have even been spotted in the last week in game. I try my best to ignore the the mini-map and use the survivor sense when I can but I would still like the option to just have them not show up. This would make the game more difficult without actually making the game more difficult. Weapons: There should be a better balance between weapons or a way to buy weaker level weapons. For example, I can no longer get my two favorite weapons the dagger and the saber. These weapons may have not done as much damage as some of the machetes do at a higher level, but they had such a high handling that it didn't really matter. I was upset to find out that after a certain amount of damage I was doomed to never see another dagger or saber in the game. Be The Zombie: This mode really needs to be more challenging for the humans. I will admit when it was a 1v1 I found the mode fun and quite challenging, but when I was playing with more than one other person it felt boring. We could easily fight off the hunter and kill the nests and maybe experience one or two deaths. That just seemed to easy. I suggest that the radar be modified so that when the humans use survivor sense they would get more of a general direction the hunter is in instead of the pin point location. They would see the mini-map light up red around the edges of the map, Basically you know how when you are being pursued the entire mini-map gets a red blur around the edges I suggest that but instead of the red blur covering 360 degrees of the mini-map it just highlights about 15-30 degrees in the direction of the hunter. However making this change would give the hunter a much better chance because the hunter may be somewhere within the mini-map area but it is only highlighting the edge of the mini-map. So this would require the humans to look for the bright orange highlight of the hunter. I would also suggest that if the hunter uses his howl to try and locate the humans his precise location would be shown to all humans in the game. Online: When I generally play this game I keep the online mode set to friends only, because I hate when people were just jumping into my game. I had to wait for them or kick them when I was trying to talk to anyone and they would expect to constantly revive them when they were dying. It was really annoying, but I had to keep dealing with this because I wanted anyone to be able to invade my game. It would be nice if we could set co-op to friends only but have it so hunters could be public.  I hope I was clear on all of my request and thank you again for making a wonderfully addicting game.Edited February 11, 2015 by mouse0270","Feature requests",1058

You would be able to run through and jump out of the windows, while beaning chased by a horde. Bring in more emergency buildings (police station, fire hall, and hospitals). A subways system would be fun as well, as a dark zone that you could enter whenever you come across the train stop's; could place a safe house in a subway car that you could move within a certain area, between the dark zone and back outside.Within this center you could bring in a more military based NPC's that you could fight/ help out.A newer type of â€œZombieâ€ like a swat/ army style that is faster and more aware when the player is within a certain distance from it, is able smell your blood if wounded.","Feature requests",1060

If you look at your outfits in your stash you can see single slots for pants,shirts, etc. and my first thought was that i could equip something in these slots. -hardcore mode: higher difficulty and the necessity to eat and drink for example. And zombies only die, if you attack the head. If you cut a zombie in half the upper half should still crawl etc. No huds too.  Most of this ideas have surely been posted before, but i am too lazy to read through 52 pages.","Feature requests",1070

"1717","Orange/Legendary (whatever you want to call them) weapons show up MUCH too often. Shopkeepers almost always have several in stock, making it so that orange weapons feel like they are the only viable weapons to use since they are obviously the most powerful. Dead Island had it right, getting an orange weapon was VERY rare and they were extremely powerful. Whenever I got an orange weapon in Dead Island, I felt like I achieved something, I felt honored to be in the presence of such a uniquely powerful weapon. In Dying Light, I blow through orange weapons like no tomorrow. Break one, oh well time to immediately replace it because there is a vendor in every building with the same exact weapon. Maybe make more weapon variants as well? For example, it would be common to get a Used Katana but more rare to get a Premium Katana. Just a thought. I believe a good fix to this problem is to give orange weapons a huge durability buff, send it through the roof. MAYBE a damage buff, but that's debatable.  After that, make it so that they are unable to be bought from shops (or at least make it extremely rare, like I'm talking a .2% chance).It is already rare enough to find an orange weapon from a chest/van, so that is fine. Make it more like Dead Island, where using blue/purple weapons were simply placeholders whilst people hunt for their very desirable orange weapons to replace them with. Also, weapon scaling is broken. Say at S level 5 you have an orange pick, and as soon as you get to S level 6 a blue pick automatically does more damage than that orange weapon from 1 level before. I'm sure you get this enough, but come on. Blunt weapons pls This game really is amazing, and it's replay value can be increased tenfold (for me) if these changes are put in. I can definitely say people would agree.Edited February 10, 2015 by Ragefires","Feature requests",1072

"1720","My battle tested input on a hardcore mode for Dying Light (READ IN DETAIL) ZOMBIE THREAT - The running zombie or viral zombie should appear more often next to the tower to add more difficulty.  They should also randomly appear in homes that you can loot hiding in the standing closets or just standing around.  The more coop players added to the game the more frequent they should appear.  This could apply to any of the special zombie types. OUTFITS - Please add all the computer player outfits to the game for the player to wear.  I love the outfit the guard is wearing in the tower next to the quartermaster, Blake is his name, not the one with the bike helmet the one in the urban vest with the police rifle and wrapped hands.  I would love to have that as an outfit.  My wife is upset she can't be a female and run around with us online you should add some outfits that change your male to a female.  One last thing.  Outfits should have helmets or gasmasks to help hide the fact that every player online looks like the same dude. PLAYER SKILLS AND THE AMOUNT OF ITEMS CARRIED AND PLAYER DEATH - We limit our carry to 1 Melee Weapon, 1 Rifle + ammo, 1 Pistol + ammo, 1 UV light, 2 Firecrackers, 2 Flares, 1 Molotov, and 3 lockpicks for our basic player needs.  If you die you should respawn at the town with nothing but your UV light.  (Note) after death or starting a fresh account the lock pick is the hardest thing to find but is the most important item because without it you can't get into police vans.  You could get a free one from the Quartermaster but that would ruin the experience.  As we loot homes we really try not to over carry items for trade for realism of course.  You must govern your self to apply this play style.  My son and I have decided that if you collect an airdrop your automatically required to return to the town and off load your current loot.  This makes for a challenging environment.  At any time if you feel the need to drop stuff to pick up other items please do so.  Use your best judgment.  There are only 4 skills needed to make the player believable, Dodge (should have a cool down) Grapple, and Stomp.  You must add one unneeded skill to unlock the stomp skill.  All the other skills just make the player over powered. IDEAS FOR HARDCORE MODE - (NOTE) one must experience this to appreciate how limited the player really is. Me and my son have finished the game and noticed that once you max out your skill tree your way OP.  We have decided to start a new account and this time we will not be spending any of our skill points to render our player much more week thus making the game harder.  There could be a few skills needed to add some realism but this will be decided once we finish the game.  (2-12-15 update) spending 4 skill points to unlock dodge, grapple, and stomp has added some realism with out over powering your player, no other skill are needed.   We have been doing this for about 2 days now and it really adds to the realism of the game, we also have decided to not use med packs for our health instead we are forced to raid homes for food and or to sleep.  My son and I have decided that you can't sleep to regain your heal unless your at 50 life or more.   This to us made the game so much more fun adding much needed team work to survive. (NOTE) this way of playing also made firearms much more needed and limited our crafting making shopping at the tower much more necessary.  I would also like to see your life bar affect your running stamina, the lower your life the less you can run and jump and climb. MORE IDEAS FOR HARCORE MODE (SHOPS/MONEY) - It is 2-11-15 thought I would give an update to our hardcore trials.  I noticed that money is not balanced well.  In a end would scenario money would have zero value so I have decided to come up with a trade system that I manage myself.  I'm really relying on my fire arms to scout for supplies because I can't get bit even once, and noticed money is way to easy to come by one of two things should be changed.  #1 bullets should cost an outrages amount of money, just like the weapons cost. $750.00 to max out my rounds is way to cheap. #2 get rid of money altogether and only have a trade/barter system with the stores to acquire weapons and bullets.  Every time I restock my bullets I'm dropping all my money and I'm not selling weapons to the store because they give you to much money for them.  In real life a pawn shop will pay you little to nothing for your items so I could only imagine in a end world environment this would become 300% worse.  Food water and weapons should be the currency. AIRDROPS - First off I love this part of the game and you should bring it back at the end so we can still help the tower giving the player something fun to do.  I think my next idea would add some anxiety to the airdrops, if your the first to respond to the airdrop you get to loot both the crates and that's great but you should set up a timer for the goons so if you hang out there to long goons get there and pin you down and force you to fight them or run.  I think that one of the goons that responds should have a police rifle to make them a threat.  I find my self waiting for other players to get to the drop location minutes after I have already looted the drop.  This would create a stand off making the game harder to survive.  ZOMBIES & WILD LIFE - I would love it if you added zombie dogs and cats to the game.  I would also like to see the child zombies added to normal game play as frequent as the spitting zombie. Thank you for your time and I hope to see some of these types of changes added to the games future content.  I will be updating this post as I adventure into your world with a hardcore mindset from time to time so please revisit my post.Edited February 18, 2015 by X Tradeph","Feature requests",1075
"1721","I would very much like to see a polished, fully functional horizontal wall-run in one of the DLCs, and it would be a lot nicer if we had better input to tell when we're actually performing a Tic-Tac versus regular climbing/jumping. Aside from that, for a game focused on melee, there's not a lot of melee control: I would like to be able to pick what direction I'm swinging from, and have the option for vertical attacks (and possibly stabs?) Finally, firearms and explosives could use a little bit of an overhaul.

"1722","Dying Light - Real Mode (Please read in detail)Would like you to evaluate this idea. The game is phenomenal, but after finish it 100%, is one wanting more. So I developed a new game formula, which in my view, would be extremely fun and tense too.. Objective: Survive as long as possible. If die, the game ends (Read below).. New start. No character import.. New character. No developed skills. No mod's projects. No weapons.. World without NPCs. No available safe houses. The two active maps from the start of the match.. World composed entirely of zombies Biters and Virals and members of the gang Kadir ""Rais"" Suleiman. . Conditions HEALTH, HUNGER, THIRST and FATIGUE. HEALTH: Recoverable with medical kits (Found only in locked ambulances) or through alcohol and gauze.- Die because of a zombie. You wake up at the nearest base of the attack site. Health, Hunger, Thirst and fatigue will be 50%. You have 24 hours to inject Antizina (Read below) or will be dead.- Dying for fall or shot. End of game.. HUNGER: Recoverable with food, of course. (Found in houses, shops etc.)- Die of hunger. End of game.. THIRST: Recoverable with water, of course. (Found in houses, shops etc.)- Die of thirst. End of game..FATIGUE: Recoverable sleeping in any conquered base.- If your fatigue bar reaches 100%, you can no longer run. You will need to sleep to recover. No matter the time you wake up, if it is day or night, can not sleep again until your fatigue bar reaches 50%.- Wake up, Health, Hunger and Thirst will be 50%.. ANTIZINA: It will only be found if it is infected. When infected, will appear within 24 hours on your screen and a delivery point on the map. It will not be easy! Deliveries will fall on top of a tower or on top of a building. Race against time is bad, any accident could occur. If deliveries do not fall in high places, dangerous, for sure they will be surrounded by gang Kadir ""Rais"" Suleiman.. SAFE HOUSE: They will have to be won in the same way that in the current game. The difference is that they will have more zombies both inside and outside. And all the safe houses have to clear the zombies, close the entries and activate the electricity.. FIREARMS and AMMUNITION: Found only in locked police cars.. SKILLS: They would be the same as the current game, but with an addition. The ability to build arrows and silencers. That's right! In addition to all existing weapons, we would have four types: bow, crossbow, shotgun and sniper rifle. Arrows and silencers will be sorely needed (Read below).. FIGHTING:- Day: World only composed of Biters zombies and gang Kadir ""Rais"" Suleiman. But be careful! All Biters act as if you Virals noise (explosions, without silencers shots, alarms etc.).- Night: World only composed of Biters zombies and gang Kadir ""Rais"" Suleiman. All Biters act as Virals if you are seen (red bar indicating the time equal to the current game).- UV Flashlight: It will help against Virals night. Same effect as the current game against volatile.. COOP: It will only be possible if the four players are not infected.- Forming up a group, it will be easier to win all groceries, via exchanges or withdrawals.- If the player has to sleep, will exit the game online. (I need to think about it)- Dying for a zombie. Health, Hunger, Thirst and fatigue will be 50%. You and / or your companions will have 24 hours to inject into you, the Antizina. When infected, will appear within 24 hours on the screens and a delivery point on the map. It will not be easy! Deliveries will fall on top of a tower or on top of a building. Race against time is bad, any accident could occur. If deliveries do not fall in high places, dangerous, for sure they will be surrounded by gang Kadir ""Rais"" Suleiman.- Dying for fall or shot. The player will be waiting fallen help of fellow (medical kits).- Die of hunger. The player will be waiting fallen help of companions (food).- Die of thirst. The player will be waiting fallen comrades help of (water).- If not rescued, end game.And it folks? Like it? Is it possible? Anyway, dreaming costs nothing.Sorry for bad english ...

"1735","Dear Techland Re. your upcoming hard mode.  Firstly, thank you so much for listening to us. You have made a brilliant game, Below are a few points which I feel are key to bringing this game back into your original vision of the game within your upcoming hard mode. Increased cool down of the grappling hook. Since I first used it I honestly haven't felt pressured within a volatile chases. It's just too easy to escape with it.  Re map visibility. Having less information given to us would be a great step towards keeping us on our toes. Perhaps removing the volatiles from the map or making the map less reliable. Possibly even removing it and keeping the start menu map which we could still use for objectives. The day / night cycle could be changed within hard mode. Perhaps keeping 7 minutes for night but having it more frequently. My friends and myself completed as much of teh game as we could at night because it was 100% more fun. The hud information could be limited within hard mode. Ammo / health count could be changed to give minimal information. The quantity of items should be limited by having a stack limit. 15x grenades per stack for eg. The quantity of medkits which can be carried should be limited. It doesn't feel like a survivor game carrying around 99 self heals.The quantity of medical drops in hard mode needs a slight decrease. When you find a medkit it should be a sigh of relief, not ""oh great that's one more for the pile""The absolute must for this new hard mode, which I'm sure you are aware of areIncreasing enemy health of all enemies. Decreasing / balancing some of the weaponry to allow for some variance.  Incentive to keep progressing through hard content. Perhaps rewards or unlocking further difficulties.hopefully you find some of this feedback useful. ","Feature requests",1090

"1742","I'd love to see the seizures implemented into regular gameplay somehow (maybe in the upcoming Hard Mode, if nothing else?). One element I loved about Dying Light was the fact that Crane (LOVE Crane, by the way, I need more of him in my life) was infected with the virus. I've always hated ""protagonist immunity"" to any important disease/curse/what have you in a story, and Dying Light handled the zombie virus and seizures extremely well. It was one of my favorite elements. So I think it'd be awesome if we kept feeling the effects of that continuously throughout the game. Not only would it be more consistent with the story missions, but it'd also offer a new level of challenge in regular gameplay if you suddenly have a seizure like the ones in certain story missions. It makes the game more immersive, since Crane's infection is a very real (and very dramatic) problem throughout the story. It'd give a sense of the desperation for a cure - and the desperation for antizin. We'd feel a little more for those renegade survivors you see running around shouting ""I really, REALLY need those suppressants!"" The seizures should also get worse and worse if you let them go for too long, and if you go long enough without another antizin shot, you eventually have a really bad seizure and then your game just ends because you change. Antizin could only be available at the two main safehouses in each zone (the Tower in the Slums and the Roost [forgive me, I forget its exact name] in Old Town), to give a feeling of how rare and valuable it is.","Feature requests",1097

"1744","My ideas for mission types!!  You know I think of some generic ones... 1) CLEAR OUT INFECTED. I really feel the the DLC mission Cargo should have been a prevalent side mission type. I feel Techland in terms of mission variety, missed a trick with this kind of mission type. Missions that have the player clear out an area of infected are always fun, and what's more are easy to create!! Examples could have been  - CLEAR OUT HOSPITAL - So survivors can get in a scavenge for medical supplies.- CLEAR OUT SUPER MARKET - So survivors can get in a scavenge for Food supplies Etc... These type of missions could if buffed out the side quests a bit! Plus a lot of the missions didn't force you to fight the infected. Whilst I like having the option. I think sometimes Techland should have forced us! Like going up against a Demolisher and needing a key for a door or a item that you need, forcing you to fight would have been a good idea. 2) Another mission type HUNT. A mission request via other Survivors. There maybe be a mission to take out a particularly troublesome special infected like a Demolisher or or say 1 Volatile hold up in some dark spooky tunnels.Or even you could have some contracts to take out one of Rais's lieutenants? Some more mission types slightly less generic.  1) FOOD SUPPLIES. This mission would see you have to go to a supermarket, or gas station to retrieve a 'bag of food'. One you picked up the bag it would hinder your ability to climb. You could still sprint but for much shorter durations. Of course at anytime you could put the bag down, say if you wanted to scout out the area your moving through or take out some trouble some zombies. In co-op you could have your buddy do this for you whilst you kept moving with the food bag strapped to you.  2) RESCUE. This mission would work in a similar way, except instead of a food bag, you would find a kid trapped, who needed rescuing and brought back to the tower. More caution would be need getting the kid back to the tower as if you put the kid down, wherever you leave the kid she would be at risk of zombie attack and being killed. So if you need to put her down to kill zombies blocking your oath or scout ahead, you would need to find a safe place to leave her, perhaps behind the counter in a store, or in a house where you can shut the door?   I think these kinds of missions wouldn't be too difficult to implement. And would give the game some variation.  Also maybe a few more missions that would have the same design philosophy as 'Mothers Day' .... Getting into Gazi's house took me a while to figure out, and it really utilised the climbing mechanics to excellent effect which created a kind of puzzle to figure out. There was a real sense of satisfaction when you finally worked out how to get on top of his roof by climbing via the pipes under the Bridge passover. Another standout Side quest for me was the mission where you had to recover journalists camera in the back of his black car, on the bridge! When his car alarm went off, and The zombies started swarming you and then his car falls off the bridge and into the ocean it was great, and the fact that you could then dive off the bridge into the ocean, swim down to the car open the trunk to get his camera out, was soon cool. Its a shame they couldn't have been more like that one.  What do you think guys? Anyone else has any ideas of missions? Perhaps ideas that could be realistically be added/implemented to the game??Edited February 12, 2015 by Lamoi","Feature requests",1099

"1750","I'm sure there have been similar requests to mine.  Here are some simple things I really would like to see in the game.   1) More weapon / more variety.  At higher levels the weapons are pretty monotonous.  Khopesh, short sword, katana, chupacabra sword, and axe are about the only things that come up, especially with decent stats.  I don't get powerful hammers or sickles or any of the other weapons.  Although I understand simplicity, it's a shame I can't really use the a powerful bludgeon weapon at high level because stats-wise they are pretty weak.  I'd also like to see more high level mods and maybe some more elements added.   2) Better guns / craft ammo.  I differentiate this from the more weapons because gunplay seems purposefully underplayed.  I can see doing a little bit, but the guns I get at max level are identical to the guns at lv 1 (except rais's gun that runs out of ammo in a few minutes).  I can get making it so melee is king, but I'd like some respect payed to guns, especially with so many enemies using them.  I'd love a pump or auto shotgun, the two barrel is not my favorite.  Even if the damage doesn't hit the 2k range of the melee weapons, it would be nice to get at least halfway up, instead of 184 for rifle.  I'd also like to see ammo plans - metal + chemicals?  If it makes it too easy, make the requirements harder.  Wouldn't hurt to be able to mod the guns as well (but I can understand the overpower if adding elemental to a fast shooting weapon) 3) Coop mode from start screen.  It's a waste of time to have to enter my main game, find a match, then enter their game, and possibly not connect and enter mine all over again.  It'd be nice if I can jump straight to co-op if that is my intention.   4) The ability or even chance to salvage weapon mods.  While I get tons of stuff to craft my weapons, good weapon mods are more rare.  They come up, but the best ones take time, and then you don't want to use the weapon, but that defeats the purpose.  It'd be nice if I could salvage at least some of the time the mods.   5) The ability to decline the zombie invasion for the other people in the game.  When I join a game, I don't know if they have their zombie invasion turned on.  Sometimes I don't really feel like doing on, but its not like I can bow out without dropping from the game altogether.  It'd be nice if there was a vote instead of just going by the main person's settings.   6) Tone down the water effect (maybe the blood / spit as well).  The water effect is pretty annoying, and sometimes triggers my motion sickness.  7) Better water movement.  Along the path to becoming the world's best freerunner, it'd be nice to be at least slightly faster at swimming.  Any swimming section takes forever.  There also could be a potion to last longer under water.  8) Bow/Crossbow - It'd be really cool to have some ranged stealth weapons.  I know stealth is only a fringe mechanic, but I like doing missions at night, it'd be nice to take out that zombie before it spots me.  I know there's thrown weapons, but a bow or crossbow would be even cooler.","Feature requests",1105

"1758","HelloAround 84% done the story now, and been playing it all coop with a friend. As the mod tools are only available for PC, I would like to input my top ideas for consideration of future expansions....1.Another Town -More country then city, larger fields, houses with a bit of property line to them (making them a bit bigger) I understand this is a huge request, but as I get closer to the ending of the story, this is one of the things thatwould make the game replayable. Maybe Erol helicopters out and turns shortly after in a different city....2.GunsMost of the replies ask for a bigger arsenal, keep in mind the 2nd expansion after Cuisine and Cargo is a large item pack. Chances are we'll see better, or more unique guns in the next expansion.3.Gun ModsI think it would be cool to pick up a silencer, scope, extended grip for more stability. Just more versatility in the guns in general.You can apply a variety of mods to melee weapons but nothing for a gun. Also did the quest where there was mention of a silencer, and never ended up being the end reward of that quest. Kind of a tease guys, lol.Other things that kind of follow up would be ability to dual wield (probably end up being op) or the abilityto board up doors/windows. The scripting is there for zombies to be able to break things, maybe a player created barricade would be a possibility without much effort?Otherwise, this has been a great game. I've enjoyed what I've played so far, and anxious to see how the story wraps up. Look forward to future DLC (already bought the season pass) Cheers. ","Feature requests",1113

"1769","I'd want a Resident Evil and Silent Hill too. Resident Evil: There would be a certain police station full of zombie officers. Then, there would be one Goon somewhere outside of the police station dressed up as Nemesis from Resident Evil 3. Not only that but there will also be a female survivor with a brunette bob hair, wearing a blue tube top, a black high waisted leather skirt, and matching boots (resembling a lot like Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil series but only this character is Turkish and has an accent similar to Jade Alsemir's). If the player fails to save her, he can pick up her American 9MM pistol with only 10 bullets in it. If the player is able to save her, the woman gives the player $8000, a modified knife (new or existing mod which will be one that deals with a major amount of bleeding damage along with the blueprint), a medkit, a lockpick, an American 9MM pistol (she still has her own) and 30 extra bullets for the pistol. Beat the ""Nemesis"" Goon and the player gets a $5000, a double handed hammer (sledge hammer) that causes major damage, an American Rifle, a blade, a medkit, and 60 extra rifle bullets. (Do note that the female survivor can help you defeat the Nemesis Goon. Just keep the Goon away from the survivor because her health isn't a lot.) Silent Hill: There would be several female zombie nurses in a certain hospital in Harran and one Goon that is dressed up as Pyramid Head. Most of the zombie nurses would have medkit a once they are looted by the player. If the Pyramid Head Goon is defeated, the player gets $6000, a very powerful double handed axe, a medkit, and any powerful mod (new or old along with the blue print) for the double handed axe.","Feature requests",1124

"1774","Hello Dying Light development team, this is my first post and I've taken the time to come up with a few suggestions for you. Hope you enjoy.Gun silencers - Take out your enemies with a swift shot to the head, but take the shot silently. Bow and Arrow (Crossbow) - Take down your enemies with ease and silence with this short - medium range weaponry.Another world (Open) - This world would need to be vast and open to exploration. A forested world with animals that you need to kill and cook to survive - This world could be left at any time. This would just be for the hardcore apocalypse players willing to do what it takes to stay breathing.More weaponry - The weapons in Dying Light are much like Dead Island - I know that it's the same Dev. team - But if you've played Dead Island, the weapons just feel the same, they don't give you the new, next gen feeling. Add guns such as sniper rifles for the stealthy ones who lurk around the city picking off only the prey between him and his destination - Grenade launchers for the ones who blast their way through the horde of zombies looking for an opponent worthy of his skill - SMGs for the ones who get in and out like clockwork. The ones who are swift on their feet and let nothing touch them Vehicles - Giant 18-Wheelers that plow through anything in its path to a motorcycle that is swift and agile between the narrow paths of the apocalypseNight Vision Goggles - For the ones who dare go out at night; the ones who lurk among the shadows and are invisible to the world - Except there is only one thing... They can see you!Hope this wasn't too corny for you to withstand. I would like to talk about the other world option a bit more in detail, though. The open, forested world would be less focused on the parkour as it is on the survival. This would could be compared to that of DayZ, but much less vast.This world should be just the right size for those who want to put in the hours and collect the supplies for their own well being. In this world, there should be towns to loot from, buildings to build, and items to craft to help you survive. I don't believe that something like this would be added, but I know I would play relentlessly if it were.Thanks for reading ","Feature requests",1129

They can see you!I agree w/ Gun Silencers but they need to be regulated/restricted in some way or it makes the game too easy to use guns & bypass melee.  Could very easily become a zombified COD. I totally dislike any animals for food-hunting or relying on food/water for sustaining health.  I had suggested rabid zombie dogs in some backyards or on streets & maybe some of them being a threat randomly - not real important though.  If I'm fleeing from Volatiles, the last thing I need is fast dogs chewing on my backside  More weaponry - one thing I do think they did is give us the feel & sound of melee weapons upon impact.  That was well done imo.  Don't know about guns yet.I wanted some random Sniper rifles on top of some rooftops - - with like 1 or 2 bullets in them so we could opt to pick off some higher threat zombies from up top to help with a horde problem or something.If hardcore players don't like that, they can just ignore any rifles on rooftops & not use them.I suggested vehicles too, I think it would be awesome to hotwire a car/truck (takes effort to use a vehicle & maybe random cars have keys in the ignition - things like big trucks take time/effort to hotwire?Adds a challenge) I suggested binoculars for daytime but I like night vision goggles alot too.","Feature requests",1130

The night and day environment and the parkour ability really turned me on to the game with the trailer. I like how some people mentioned silencers. It would be neat to to be able to mod a silencer for the guns (besides the shotgun) of course.  The other suggestion would be more rendered cutscenes actually showing the main character. We never see Kule Crane. I could identify with him more if we saw him more and his reactions to the story. The voice acting was great, and we see that Crane is a redeemable character who does what's right. ","Feature requests",1132
"1778","Developers, please add the option to disable the slow-motion. It only prevents to play.It would be good for both the single-player campaign and multiplayer:- To impose a restriction on the number of used items (depending on size / weight)For example, a maximum of Molotov cocktails - 3, explosive packages (grenades, etc.) - 3 flashes - 5, etc. The game has unlimited number of components for crafting.- To reduce the number of slots used items (to make 2 instead of 4);- Reduce the number of slots for weapons (2 slots).At this moment, the game is very easy, especially at the top level.

"1779","I can't afford to read all the previous comment, but I will make some suggestion. 1. Variety of weapons in this game. Once you're at max level. You don't have that many weapon of choice. I'm not a fan of shooting, so I will stick to melee. Different kind of swords, frying pan, guitar, golf club, hammer etc. 2. Replay value. The NG+ should be dramatically harder. If current level is at max at 25, maybe extend to 35... Weapon base damage will be higher and skills to be unlocked to improve character. 3. A skill system... My idea is that once you leveled up, you only have one skill point to spend to either survival, agility , or power. You only can gain higher level with NG+. 4. On NG+, some main story mission cannot be complete alone, encourage multiplayer teamwork.To be honest, missions are quite easy that somebody will just rush and chop enemies on sight. Thats not the ideal teamwork for me. 5. Remove grappling hook! I won't deny that I enjoy using grappling hook. Its really helpful. But the tradeoff is huge. Finding route, climb up the roof are not challenging  in the game anymore.Or nerf it alots for example: Limited the use only 3-5 times then the hook will break. You will need to buy from NPC with quite a high price and not all NPC have it on sales. 6. I'd love to see a new city to explore. New loots, new challenges, new quests, new achievements , new quarantine zones.I do not forget that Harran is a restricted zone, but who knows what you can do to extend a story. An outbreak leaked from Harran to a nearby city through sewer? Developers can make a really big DLC to sell with more story quests, and I'm sure people will love it.On another note, Crane said to GRE at the end to wait for his signal right? What will GRE do at the end? Will they deploy more agent to seek out for the file? Will Crane have to fight to protect Doctor Camden? My imagination just ran wild. 6.5. A new city with two or three faction to join with benefits and tradeoffs if possible. Faction A. Benefits Breckon's Tower on supplies but they do not have a decent weapon, while Faction B have a good weapon, but low supply. 7. Allow us to date/romance, freely interact with NPC in game. Its not really matter but I just love to see it. 8. Being a zombie is quite difficult. I would suggest that survivor cannot detect hunter if he don't scream to spot survivor. Hunter lost great disadvantages as survivor can camouflag. The only thing I find it challenging in this game is to help a group of survivors vs demolishers. That's pretty much to what I want developers to work on. A feedback from developer would be great as I wanna know which of my ideas is to be considered or too naive. I know techland knows how to make their game fun! I just love to see more! Well, just one suggestion of one player! Do your best techland!Edited February 16, 2015 by tumsiit54","Feature requests",1134
"1780","Another 2cents from Mr Hydra.  Silencers - Here is why I don't want them in the game. Guns in dying light work similar to guns in the walking dead, if you shoot then they will cause noise and that is generally bad in a city full of flesh eating monsters. Trying to make them more effective by adding a silencer would be really useful and makes complete sense. It would let us shoot without risking our own health and i'm sure that is what many of you are thinking.  BUT  This is a game, and making things easier is inversely proportional to making it more fun. Whilst we are thinking, hey lets make some guns silenced so we can kill without harm, we might as well be adding riot suits so we can't be bitten, tactical nukes and IR snipers.. You see that currently the guns work on a basis that they come with a cost, you gain the benefit of being able to kill something from range which gives you an advantage however this comes with a price, that a couple virals are going to be really interested in chasing your bumbum. It's a trade off of stats. Like the 2-handed weapons that do more damage, they come with a stamina cost and swing more slowly. If techland were to implement silencers it would be a reward/no risk situation, from a gaming perspective this should never ever be the case as it will become ""the meta"" and the only thing people would ever need to use. The only forgivable situation I could possibly conceive of is having a custom silencer last 5-6 shots or perhaps even have a 10% chance of failing or falling off.  Bottom line - Techland please don't add silencers, they don't fit with the story of the game. Military and police don't walk around the streets using silencers so why would there be any, and it isn't set in the US where such items would be manufactured. They would make night time combat far too easy and any combat at all for that matter. They would result in us getting chased less often and therefore doing much less free running.   ","Feature requests",1135

"1782","Well, my English is pretty bad, but i gonna try to suggest anyway  1. Right now plants respawns is way too quick, and because of it on level 4-5, its a ""bufftime"" 24/7, and running without stamina all the time.  Make plants respawn once per day. 2. Airdrops, right now, ended too quick. Player only complete 5-8 missions and that it. Airdrops becoming rare and then ended. It's fun try catch airdrops first, so why ended them so quick? Also that's enemies who sometimes makes first to the airdrop is just too weak, and in airdrops usually contain nothing useful, beside item that you give to quartermaster. Maybe make enemies stronger, give them firearms, add to airdrops random weapon mods, and make some sorts of ""the Tower survive scale"" that going with time lowering, but can increased by giving in that ""live support"" item to quartermaster. And when ""Tower survive scale "" at full, player will be rewarded with some bonus? Like for example lowering prices in tower shop? Or shops going to sold more suff? Like mods, and rare parts or blueprints? 3. Make more missions/challenges in night time. 4. Please make some kind of autoloot, or very quick loot, or at least ""filter"" for ""survivor sense"". Because when enter in some location with a lot of stuff, it just too much painful to loot it all, spend 1-2 second for every box with items. Yeah there is skill which make looting quicker, but not for enough. 5. And finely, yes, makes silencers. It's just weird that character can build complicated bombs from scratch, but can't make simple silencer. Make them with ""durability"" which going to lowering fast. Also maybe add a sniper rifle?","Feature requests",1137

"1786","Well, I've been thinking, and I've come up with some more suggestions for the team behind Dying Light.Apocalypse (Hardcore) Mode - In this mode, you would have to rely on your ability to scavenge for food and water to survive. You could have Starvation meter and a Dehydration meter, which would go down over time if you didn't replenish Food and Water. In Co-op, you would have to communicate with your teammates as to when you need to go scavenging. Zombies would be harder to kill, your character would have less health, and take more damage per hit. Night time would be even more hectic than it already is. Communication would be key to surviving in this mode. Unlimited leveling - This could be compared to 'Skyrim' - Your character could have a 'Level' or 'Apocalypse Rank,' whatever you wish to call it, and with the increase of this level, your character could increase day-to-day abilities. For example ,once you level, you could upgrade 'Lockpicking' or 'Looting'. Locks would become easier to pick, and your character would find noticeably more loot per upgrade. This would add a constant goal to your game.  Make your own course - Competition is a valuable part of this game. I think it would be cool for users to design their own running course, or zombie killing course.   For example (Zombie killing course), users could pick spots on the map where users would be thrown into a pit of zombies and would compete for most zombies killed, or least damage taken, etc.. For another example (Running course) Users could look at the map and choose checkpoints that users need to pass in order to win the race (Much like the agility challenges in campaign, but user created and unique.) Those are just a couple of things I thought would be cool to add into the already awesome game.

"1787","Hello! I guess I'm late for the party with my asks, but it still better late than never, right? ^___^As I like Brecken a lot, I'd like to see more of him in, well, maybe some DLC-ish sequels or something. Because, you see, after Crane travels to Zone 0, it feels like he just vanishes from the storyline at all, and it doesnt feels good and is not right, because he is interesting and great character and his interactions with Crane is so bro that it worms my heart.)So, more Brecken and his developing friendship with Crane would be great, he deserves more, not just beating from bad guys and constant anguish...","Feature requests",1142
"1788","Hello everyone!I have played this game one hell of a lot, i have done everything possible in it so am awaiting more DLC in the future! Love it to bits.Now i don't know whether this has been mentioned in previous reply's to this topic or not but what i think would be a fantastic addition to this game would be some more focus around the parkour element. Techland have done the parkour well, I've yet to run into any problems that make playing the game difficult, so great work there! What i think would be great, would be to add another skill tree, another mode which you can select or de-select in options or button press (i.e as a playstation 4 user R3 and L3 together) which enables a more focused parkour mode. For instance, you can run faster because you wouldn't be carrying a weapon, you can jump higher and further, as you are running the longer you hold the 'Jump' button down for the higher/further you will launch when the button is released. What i ALSO think would be good fun, would be to earn 'style points' or 'parkour points' which will contribute to levelling up the 'parkour' skill tree or whatever the name may be, which you can only earn in this focused parkour mode I'm talking about here. And similar to the other skill trees the more you do i.e the better jumps you do, transfers, vaulting, successful landings etc. you earn more points and can then gain access to further skills in the skill tree, one example i have would be to unlock the ability to perform somersaults. I'm thinking the way that would work is that in this 'parkour mode' the button which is used to kick (i'm playstation 4 user so L2) would become the 'somersault' button. i.e after jumping hold L2 (kick) and the left stick would then act as what rotation you wish to perform. So forward push = Frontflip, downwards push = Backflip, Left = left rotation Right = right rotation etc.. But this done in such a way that you don't just push forward and the flip automatically completes, you have to keep the stick held forward, back, left, right until the desired action is completed and if successful get 'style points' if unsuccessful, fall and of course lost time and run the risk of being attacked by zombies/rais's men. In addition to all of this, another skill you could acquire would give the player the ability to swing around a pole/lampost so if being chased you can jump to a pole and what i think would work well is use L1 as a grab button in this 'parkour mode', jump, grab, the longer you hold 'grab' (L1) button the further around you go and of course let go of 'grab' (get a little boost of height and speed) and off you go again. This would add even more fluidity to the parkour element which would let you traverse the world faster, easier, there would be less moments of your motion stopping and gives you a great way to avoid the zombies.  This 'mode' could be implemented in such a way that it just uses buttons that are already mapped but become another use in this 'parkour mode' like i said, you could use L1 for grab instead of using an item, L2 for acrobatics instead of kick. Other buttons and skills could be kept like vaulting off a zombie when jumping near one. Think of how many different ways players could implement this into combat aswell. It would need to be easy to activate so ideally something like pressing R3 and L3 together activates and de-activates 'parkour mode' would be fantastic. Imagine running down a street in 'parkour mode', or rooftops seeing a zombie ahead of you with a group of them behind it. Imagine this sequence:  1.run up to it 2.vault off of it 3.do a flip/rotation in the air4.while in the air, press R3 and L3 together to exit parkour mode5. out comes your weapon that was previously used (this example two handed axe)6. hold O (circle, or crouch button) and do that smash into the crowd of zombies7. go back into 'parkour mode' and run off once again.Come on, how epic would that look and feel?That's just one example of things you could do to implement combat with this aswell. Well, these are just a couple of suggestions i have in my head of what i really think would be great and enhance the experience even more so, this could be implemented in future DLC or an addition in an update either way i would be over the moon with this kind of addition. I do hope this all makes sense to everyone and would be fantastic if the developers saw this, even better to have it implemented! Thankyou for taking your time to read my thoughts!Sam.","Feature requests",1143

"1817","Here are a few more suggestions for the Devs. Outfits and Customization - Whilst wondering around the wasteland of Haran, you tend to find outfits here and there. Well, since you can only apply Full Costumes to your character, user customization is hindered. The player should be able to fully customize his/her character to their own liking. Allowing the changes of Head wear, eye wear, shirt, pants, and shoes would allow the user to make the look of their own character the way they want it to look. Add collectible costumes - Add costumes that are rare, and if the idea above is implemented, make the full costume in different locations. For Example, a Hazmat suit, consisting of four individual pieces (Helmet , chest, leggings, boots) could be located around the map. Helmet, chest, leggings, and the boots would all be in separate locations. Suit Ideas - Here are some suggestions to add to the collection of outfits - Ghillie suit, Hazmat suit, Ninja suit, Zombie suit, Army suit, SCUBA diving suit (Just for fun), Police Officer suit. Thanks for reading!","Feature requests",1172

People are working on fixing the issues within the game but dedicating every single member of techland towards solving bugs isn't going to help. Especially when some of them will be artists, graphic designers or even cleaners. Be happy they are taking ideas from the community and working towards making future content. It sucks you aren't getting the game to work but techland aren't going to be giving a refund unless you purchased it directly from them. Unfortunately you are in the 0.01% who aren't able to play. The game probably ran fine in beta with a few thousand people playing it. But when you release a game on the open market, errbody running different systems, someone is going to get the short straw. You are that somebody  Good luck in your efforts. ","Feature requests",1175

"1825","Hello Techland.I'm an eager modder, with a history of poking at games going back to Half-Life 1. I've not yet dug into your game, contenting myself with a near-vanilla playthrough to understand it before I try changing it, using only 'MiniHUD' to remove the minimap and unnecessary details. I'd like to remove the health too, but.. Eh, I can't be bothered to try to figure that out just yet.My suggestion and hope is that you'll consider permitting the game to recognise both modded and unmodded content simultaneously. Put as simply as I can; I'd like to be able to run around in singleplayer with my HUD turned off and whatever other small tweaks I need to enhance the game's realism. I would like to have my world invaded, potentially, by Night Hunters once the sun sets, and at that time have my mods automatically switched off and reverted to vanilla, both as an anti-cheat measure and as a balance measure. In competitive multiplayer, variance cannot be permitted, it won't be fun or fair.But needing to switch off my game, deactivate my mods, and start back up, then play at night waiting for an invasion with specific intent, while frustrated by the features I wanted modified... Agh, troubling.If you could find a way to reload the simpler .pak files like the HUD in Data3 at invasion-time, that would be wonderful.Alternatively or additionally, I'd be very impressed if you simply gave us HUD removal options like Assassin's Creed in a future patch, as part of a commitment to providing a hardcore challenge for your fans who want to keep playing the game more than once.Thanks for reading =)","Feature requests",1180

"1827","Hello all, Well I came here to put some of my ideas and hopefully they are being supported and add them to the game. These ideas are about story mode. 1, The game should not end only in one way. It should have many ways of ending. For example Jade ahd her brother should not have died or make it in two way. Chose to let them turn into zombies and kill them or let them stay alive and after we kill Rise we can still do more missions together. Like in GTA 5 where Franklin can chose to kill Michael or Travor or let them both survive and go for the bad guys. Adding more missions after Rise is dead is really nice. 2, Allowing Crane not to stick with Rise or GRE. Why should Crane not hide some of the antizin and help some individuals from not turning into zimbie? I would really love to have the game having two or 3 way of ending.","Feature requests",1182
"1828","First off let me say that this is one amazing game. It has its share of issues (such as the poor story) but what it sets out to do it does extreamely well. I think you have an excellent foundation:- fantastic gameplay- amazing atmosphere and level design What I think you should is build upon those some more: more monster types, better balancing, more side quests, missions types and challenges.You nailed the gameplay. You nailed the world and the sandox experience,. What we need is more toys to play with in there. Add those as DLC or expansion packs and this game could have a very long life.","Feature requests",1183

"1830","Hello Techland, I made an account for two reasons.  1. To support your team and this excellent game.2. This thread. Below, I will post a few ideas that I think would greatly strengthen Dying Light, and hopefully help a great game become even greater. â——Customization: Now I haven't looked at any of the other poster's ideas, but I'm sure this has to be at the top of the list for most requested features. It might be a little too late for this seeing as the story revolves around a male character, so any support for female created characters is out the window. Krane could be a female's name, but I'm sure at several points in the game it mentions Krane as a male. Regardless, customization is a MUST for this type of game. I was playing in a four-player co-op match last night and we looked like quadruplets. It was funny, but it really broke the immersion. Changing outfits is cool, but we need an option to change each individual article of clothing. It would really make each character fits the player's style, and add variety to co-op.  Clothing is one thing, but your character's face is an entirely different beast that needs customization. Like I previously said, every player looks the exact same. Tweaking the game at the start by giving an option to change your hair and beard style would be amazing. It's a small feature, but it would have a huge impact. You can retain the male lead, Krane, while still offering variety in looks for those doing c0-op.  â——'Disable HUD' Option: Out of all the ideas mentioned, this is probably one of the easiest to implement. Once I got into the open world, the first thing I did was go to the Options Menu to disable the HUD, but was saddened to see that it wasn't an option. I think this feature would immensely add to the immersion. Let's not forget to mention that it would add to the difficulty as well. Having no radar would be a challenge, but it's one that die hard fans would be up for.  I'm still new to Dying Light, but I'm not done giving my feedback and ideas. PLEASE take the previous two ideas into consideration Techland!Edited February 22, 2015 by Hoodlum","Feature requests",1185

Players could be fixing things while the other players could provide cover fire until it is fixed.  Be the zombie could be utilized in this manner giving a stronger sense of urgency.  Thus creating a real sense of survival and the gut-wrenching fear that comes along with playing at night.Edited August 8, 2015 by Bo Bo The Yeti","Feature requests",1195

"1847","This thread is the place to post all of your ideas and feature requests for Dying Light development team. We cannot promise you we will implement your ideas, since Dying Light is at a stage where most of the features are already defined and implemented, but we'll definitely consider them. Gamers feedback and wishes are something that we want to be aware of as much as possible. If you wish to discuss any of the ideas posted in this thread, please create an appropriate thread in General Discussions forum and only post a link to it in this thread. @Pawel Modlinski I played the game with a friend and here's my ideas, suggestions, features... Just remember a game like this need realism, how? Well, lot of side quests, side quests with good rewards, hardest quests and by realism I mean, some examples: Helping a guy but you can chose what side, for a better example I remember some quests in Skyrim where you can decide selling or not a mine, or some people searching for a enemy and you can deliver the npc or help killing the others.. In both sides you get cool rewards so you can play it again and test the other way. Or being a nice guy or a evil one... Also this is linked with realism because the environment changes, In one quest of Dying Light you help a guy to stop working with Rais and leave, you tell him to work with Brecken in the tower but I search for him and don't found in the tower... maybe I'm wrong maybe not, but this is realism, seeing new people coming or leaving and giving more side quests, talking with all or most npcs for hints or more history about Harran and the outbreak, just a remember people: in the game you got day cycle, at night is more dangerous so I wanna see npcs going to sleep and some more watching and protecting the safe zones, at day people cleaning, working or helping others in the safe zones, in the garden at the top of the tower or training in ""the gym"". Make Harran ALIVE with zombies at day and night and with npcs the same, why no protecting a npc but at night? These are some examples but there's a lot to talk about new ideas and features.

"1848","End Game Weaponry Is Excluding Some Of Our Favorite Weapons. Please, Technland, Allow Vendors To Sell These Items As Combat Is Get Stale Without Them. Basically hitting Survivor rank 25 means the only weapons you can have are Katanas, Double-Bladed Axes, Khopeshs, and a few sword variants.I can no long enjoy any blunt weaponry among many other popular melee weapons such as knives, hatchets, baseball bats and sledgehammers.  I'm sure I'm not alone in asking for this; and its not a big demand either, rather, it encourages creative brutality. I shouldn't have to invade random peoples games, under Survivor rank 20, and threaten them with airstrikes if they don't provide me with the larger variety of weaponry only they have access to. (Of course I don't actually do this, I prefer to trade and make it a win-win, but you get the point). Speaking of which, explosives shouldn't harm your fellow Survivors. I mean, the NPC Survivors, fine, let me team-kill them....... especially when I waste my time defending their sorry butts from a Demolisher only to be rewarded with $2000 or an Assassin weapon upgrade. Oh yes, I enjoy seeing the light escape their eyes as freeze them using a Freeze DIY Grenade and allow a biter to slowly rip their throat out; or watch as they are blown into the sky or off a building to their death by an Airstike or Explosive Trap Bomb. But my friends? No. I shouldn't have the power to end their life in a coop orientated game like this and they definitely shouldn't be able to trap me within a safe house by constantly spamming Airstrikes outside of the doorway...... all of them, laughing at me and at my pain as I cry and weep if I would ever see the light again until I am finally released in exchange for handing over my favorite and most prized water pipe..... *sniff* *sniff*..... it shouldn't be like that........ not my precious, beautiful water pipe...... it isn't fair! WHY? WHY!!!!!! All I do now is stand on firecrackers with my eyes closed and weep for my long lost water pipe that I have forever longed to be with again as I am ripped apart by a horde of infected. Then I respawn and do it all over again in spite of the bottomless void in my life caused by my long lost water pipe. I sometimes dream that one day, we will be reunited....... and I will slowly and carefully move my hand over its long metallic structure and cry tears of joy as I turn its handle that serves no real purpose as the pipe is no longer attached to any pipeline. But no....... the water pipe has a purpose, as it is has a place in my heart, and it is a part of who I am....... it is ultimately attached, not to a pipeline, but to my soul. Me and my water pipe were meant for each other, ever since the day I found it all alone by itself. I still remember that day; I just slayed a very obese Toad with my Premium Katana modded with 3 Kings and an Angel Sword..... when I saw it. A lone water pipe, abandoned on the streets. I immediately dismantled my Premium Katana to obtain 1 Metal Gear..... which I used to repair the water pipe, and help it recover from its injuries out in the dangerous city of Harran. I nurtured the water pipe.... watched it grow..... gave it a King upgrade...... and even modded it with Boltor Poison............... and just like that...... my water pipe was taken from me, stolen.... a piece of my heart, ripped from my soul. Never to be seen again......... *sniff* *sniff*...... *Spoilers*24 Survivor ranks later and I still continue my search for the water pipe I once loved...... the water pipe that I still love. I go vendor to vendor to see if any of them were sold a water pipe from another survivor....... but alas, my Survivor rank is too high to even ask. So tragic..................I have come so far, sacrificed so much, watched so many of my close friends die.... Amir..... Jade...... all for the chance that my water pipe would return to me. And it was for nothing......... my water pipe remains somewhere, unknown, gone..... disconnected from me....  I hear talk about Gods, the creators of Harran...... Techlanders, they call them..................with the power to enlighten the minds of the vendors and give them the ability to look past discrimination of Survivor ranks and allow the sale of all forms of weaponry to anyone....... only then, will I have the chance to be reunited with my beloved water pipe...... only then, will I find peace. I pray to you, Techlanders! Please! do me this favor! Enlighten our vendors! Return to me my Water Pipe! I will be forever grateful! -Buddy (in all seriousness, I would love to see lower survivor rank weapons implemented in end game, or survivor rank 25. )Edited February 25, 2015 by buddy","Feature requests",1203

"1858","Features I would love to see: (note: have not finished the entire game just yet. These items are mostly listed for the awesome and fun factors I have not yet seen in a zombie game.) 1. Assassination cut scenes based on your unique situation at the time. Millions of applications for this. Examples:Close to a fence railing and just knocked the zombie into it? Assassination cut scene time! Reach down and grab their head, then keep slamming it into the bar until it breaks. I would gladly spam  (X) for that.  Next to a barrel with fire burning in it? Kick a Zombie into it, then use a couple throwing knives to quickly staple their forearms to the sides of the barrel and let it burn. Serves it right for trying to eat your face! 2. Black Tar gun. How hilarious would that be? Got a herd of runners after you... Launch some tar in their way and their feet get stuck. In a frantic rage to get you some may tear their own feet off only to further become stuck in the tar.  3. Combined weapon mods. Examples: harpoon gun with an under barrel shotgun or vice versa. It would be insanely fun to harpoon zombies to the wall, then wall up and shotgun the ones who survive the harpoon... Turning them into red paint on the wall. Shotgun with under barrel liquid nitrogen grenade launcher. Freeze... BLAM! 4. Did I mention Liquid Nitrogen grenades?  Freeze a group of zombies then go to town on them with heavy rebar or a sledgehammer. Good clean wholesome family fun, right? I've been wanting this in a zombie game for years. No one has done it to my knowledge.  5. Compressed air cannon. Charge it up, wait for the zombie to get in your face... FOOM! Zombie goes flying like a bowling ball into the rest of the herd of zombie bowling pins. Only works on light zombies. Runners or normal zombies for example.  6. Craft able liquid nitrogen bullets for a revolver specifically. Large magnum rounds with a limited capacity, mostly just good for disabling specific zombie body parts like arms and legs with a single shot.  7. A dodgeball. Doesn't do much damage, but hilarious to ping slow zombies with, only really deadly to the spitting zombies if you hit them in the mouth at the right time. This would be infinitely funnier with liquid nitrogen or a black tar gun/bomb. Slow the zombies down and keep pinging the same one in the face for laughs.  8.

"1870","Maybe add/change the story, add more weapons and some abilities possibly. Could maybe broaden the zombie-type classes (add more zombie types). Also if you can, add some more take-down moves!!!  My #1 idea: Include antizin in the airdrops, or some airdrops. Give each player like an infection rate in which if it gets to a point too high, you start having seizures and if your teammates don't have any antizin with them to inject you, then you turn into a viral, you randomly start to attack your teammates and then carnage is unleashed. Once you die as a viral, you automatically restart as a survivor.  I think with my #1 idea being said, it would make the game feel more realistic; but at the same time, it might feel like rushing the player to be outside of the safe zones 24/7.Thanks for reading my ideas and I greatly appreciate it!","Feature requests",1225
"1871","Come out with patches in a timely fashion. Release a game when it is actually finished.These are all swell ideasEdited March 3, 2015 by Uwwfball","Feature requests",1226
"1872","First time posting here, so just going to jot down my thoughts. I'm 100% complete with 40 hours into the game.One of the things most lacking in Dying Light is firearms, yeah yeah I know they're not the focus but they're fun, so I'd like to see firearms fleshed out. First there needs to be more variety, 3 just isn't enough. Another huge improvement would be allowing us to modifying and upgrade our guns, much like what's possible in Dead Island 2. Silencers, exploding rounds, the possibilities are endless. You broke my heart when Rupert mentioned silencers but you never actually get a blueprint for it. While we're on the subject of ranged weapons, where are the bows and crossbows? They'd be weapons of choice for sure if an outbreak really happened, plus they'd be really fun to use. Poison tipped arrows, arrows that split and ""multi shot"" etc.Moving away from firearms I'd also like to see more blunt weapons added to higher level play, currently they just drop off after a certain level and all you can buy are bladed weapons, this should be easy to fix and patch.Finally I'm dying (sorry) for more story progression, I really hope you opt to further the story in the form of DLC which I'll happily pay for, I wouldn't want to have to wait years for Dying Light 2 to get my fix. The season pass DLC is honestly weak (I'm sorry but it is) and not really worth the price, but I bought it anyway because Dying Light is one of my favourite games of all time and I wanted more, even if that more was only two 5 minute challenges.Edited March 4, 2015 by MrH","Feature requests",1227
"1873","Helloi really like this game but i would like to seea Crossbow (or just a bow),suppresor for guns and maybe a scope, snipers, just some more firearms,and i really love the idea for base building and base defending. i don't know if thats all possible.(Srry for bad english) ","Feature requests",1228
"1874","Hi there, My first post and just wanted to put forward, as well as support some, ideas for future additions to the game. first off, I just wanted to say that Dying Light is one of if not my absolute favourite games ever, so much fun, especially when in co-op which has been done perfectly (finally someone gets co-op gamers).  Things I'd like to see would be: 1. Recurve/Compound bow - an absolute must as a silent ranged weapon, add flame/poison and you could have so much fun;2. A silencer for your pistol - make it really difficult to acquire, i.e. really hard side quest to make it a worth prize;3. Character customisation - this way when on co-op my team mates don't all look the same so I don't have to keep checking which person is which colour. The host would remain as Craine whilst the guests would be other scouts, that way no one would complain about breaking the immersion, etc.;4. Wall running - Or rather being able to spring from a adjacent wall to reach higher up ledges, nothing unrealistic but something which would add a little extra fluidity;5. Throwable/launchable blades - The circular saw blades would make an excellent improvised weapon, maybe some kind of launcher for them to allow them to be used as projectiles rather than just crafting items could provide a whole world of fun. Even if my thoughts are ignored by the Devs and they don't see the (Dying) light by including bows, thanks for an awesome game!","Feature requests",1229
"1875","First post in Ideas and requests. I have 250 + hours and 3 maxed level characters in this game. 50/50 achievements. There are many great ideas in this thread. The only big one I want to see is the weapon system. Currently, it's not that great. There are many different weapons in the game which is amazing. My biggest concern is that we can't find any other lower level items once you reach a certain level with you character. For instance, all 3 of my characters are maxed out. The main weapons I am finding are the superior short sword and the katana. Great weapons for sure with high damage. My Katana has (without upgrade or mod) 1402 damage. Upgraded with the angel sword blueprint, I'm doing 2595 damage. These swords are all too common for me to find. I find them 1389 to 1400 constantly at the maxed out skill levels for the character. Next,  I've ran around with them for so long, I want to use something different. Maybe, someone wants to make the game harder so I can't just one hit zombies with whatever weapon I am using.  I can't find a military machete or ice climbers pick axe anymore. I would like to see the weapons systems changed so we can have access to all different weapons at all levels. These katanas should be able to be found, but more rare than what they currently are. Same for the superior short swords. The weapon system needs an update.","Feature requests",1230
"1876","One new thing that would be incredibly amazing if possible, would be modding on the consoles. I don't know how you would do it, but it'd be something new and amazing. To somehow release modding tools for a console game would attract a lot of attention. Some games have in-game communities where people can post things they have created so everyone can play it (ex: FarCry 4) and modding would take that to the next level and help consoles catch up to the some PC gaming exclusives. Since I heard you guys supported modding on the pc version, I suddenly felt like I had the wrong decision getting the ps4 version, since mods allowed so much more possibilities for the game.  I know it's a hard thing to implement into a console game, but I guaranty it could cause a revolution for console gaming, and it could start to be implemented into other games as well. Whether the revolution does or doesn't happen, the possibility of modding a console game would absolutely be amazing.","Feature requests",1231
"1877","Not sure whether to post this here or in the problems forum, but would it be possible to have the option to trigger vault with a hotkey or double jump, rather than simply jumping? My friends and I have had problems using drop kick and other air based moves because vault triggers before you can use them, especially in co-op with latency and other players moving in front of you.","Feature requests",1232
"1878","Hi Guys!First of all let me express my gratitude for releasing this gem!What i'd love to see in Dying Light is an ""extended mode"" or a sandbox mode in which you can regulate the spawn algorhythms of the zombie and survivor types.I think you made an awesome open world playground so why not make the most of it by inhabiting it with the kind of enemies you want to fight? I'd totally buy that as a dlc for my ps4 and i guess it wouldn't be that hard to create since the spawn algorhythms change during the singleplayer. Thanks for reading ","Feature requests",1233
"1879","Since the games on a pause, let's consider idea's outside the box. Gamers love drama in post apocalyptic series where desperate measures are taken. Given that the game looks a lil similar to the Dead Island franchise, I know you peeps can do better. Your on a new engine made from scraps. Implementing game sturctures where any thing is a weapon is a choice. Anything can be used as a weapon, such as a chupacabra driver. Make this game real as possible and the limits impossible. People have been wanting to play a post apocalyptic game for ages together. Now I heard that the 4 players that are given to us are apart of the story, and they inhabated some kind of immune system like the players on Dead Island. Make it where if you get bitten, you have 10 to 30 minutes to fully develope into a man-eaten riot. Cures can be found only at military breakdowns or helecopter crashes. Give the A.I.'s their own emotion towards sudden outcomes. Scratch all of this but if you can make this into a The Last of Us emotion base feeling, then you people got nothing to worry about. I find the idea of having 10-30 minutes before transforming into a Zombie after getting bitten pretty hilarious. Certainly would inject a new level of urgency and danger if that were added. Hell, my suggestion was for more traps. (9) Elite enemies: You could consider making elite versions of enemies, like in Diablo games. For example, you take any enemy type, and when they are elite, they have more hit points, but they also have extra features. In a way, Dead Island has some of this already implemented: some zombies had helmets that prevented some damage to the head, and some carried weapons. What you could do is allow some zombies to have a weapon that causes additional bleeding (like the ones the player crafts) or has ""affixes"" such as ""zombie can emit a toxic cloud"" or ""zombie enters a rage--moving faster and dealing more damage"". We know that Dying Light already has many varities of zombies, and that these serve to challenge players in new ways, but I thought I'd bring up elite enemies because it might make the game more random and therefore increase it's replayability.  Making the game have elite/champ packs like D3 would definitely increase the my level of addiction for the game. Also it would make some of the enemies actually interesting to fight, being more then just punching bags for my own amusement.","Feature requests",1234
"1880","I am thinking to expand the story mode in which you can play as Jade Aldemir; right before the incident, you can literally choose WHO gets the antizin. Yet, Jade has a different story line than Crane. Maybe she saves Harran, or maybe she has different abilities! In which you can choose to either play as her or Crane. Just a thought, but maybe the story line can be where much more dangerous, where only the skilled survive! This will boost the suspension and give an adrenaline-kick!   ","Feature requests",1235
"1881","HiPlease add more weapons for high end players, i am lvl 25 survivor and playing with 5 weapons in a game that contains hundred is completely boring.

"1882","Dear TechLand,I love Dying Light. Here my ideas how to make it even better:-Sterescopic 3D: the game must be seen in 3D-Skill to Parry and defend the soldiers' attack just like they defend or parry ours: better, tactical, far fights againts solders-Throw any object just like the gastanks: very fun-Hide in the closets: good when Nightmare or Runner zombies are after us, more horror-like, especially in Hard Mode-Cross-platform coop-Firing and aiming with guns and throwables behind the covers without fully leaving it or standind up: better and tactical fights againts soldiers with guns-Gun customization, Silencers, bow: for stealth gameplay.-The game have a very good soundtrack, it is a shame that almost every music is only for main quest, so I would like to listen to them more, for example the 'Stife' when fighting againts a squad of soldiers, and 'In the cage' when fighting against a lot of zombies: this would motivate players while fighting-The option to reset Safe houses, OutpostsThere is bug I have found (only one!): the weapons are damaged even if I hit nothing but the air!-Story DLC?/ DL2? The story is not over!For next game like this:-Everything that this game has, plus what I told, and new things that you are planning-Decisions for better replayability-Longer story with even more dramatic and horror elements-Bigger map, with varied places and vehicles to go faster and far in the map. That way the level design would be easier because there would be places where were only roads and mountains, forests between the parkour paradise cities. It would be even more horror to break down in such place where we can not really hide of the Nightmares, there would be also parkour in the nature. It would be a lot of fun running over the zombies with various craftable vehicles, and these would not have a lot of health, as well there would be a lot of object and wrecks on the road, near abandon houses, so that way it would not ruin the parkour, which is needed for skills as we know.My favourite game, game of the year, very good developer team as well!

"1903","In my opinion, I would say it would be a lot more logical to have asked for ideas, features and/or feedback before the game was actually released. And for us to have received a closed/open beta for it as well. It's likely that the things I suggest wouldn't/couldn't happen now. The first thing I find rather annoying, is hard-coded keys. I play left-handed and I'm forever moving my whole arm all over the keyboard to press X, C, F6, T, Space etc..... I like to rebind everything to what's around my hand on the cursor keys. With the exception of Murdered:Soul Suspect, I have never found another game that was this much of a pain with disallowing me keys that can be changed. Using AutoHotKey would just be a huge mess, since I also use the internet during play! I don't see why so many games open-world games with this type of UI give us one that's atrocious......or is it just me that thinks this? When I get a dozen quests in the game, I have to keep going between map and quests, map and quests, map and quests, just to see the location of every quest. Surely it couldn't have been hard to have the map on about 8/10 of the screen and a small box in the top right side giving us a list of all quests with the description for the one that's currently highlighted under it. That way, I can zoom out of the map fully and just click downwards on each individual quest to see its location. This saves me from spending 70% of my time in the game running from one location to another and 5% messing about with the clunky inventory/map/quests. If this could be implemented into the game now, then this would be great. But I've seen it in the other Dead Island games as well as Borderlands. When I play split screen with my mate on the 360, he just puts his map up and I quickly cycle down each quest. This saves us time and doing quests that are closer to each other first before moving on.  I also hate that there's no map travel. The above issue with the quests wouldn't be as annoying if there was such a thing in the game. At least then I'd waste less time with my character getting out of breath running 100's of metres between locations. I also can't stand that we have yet another character that's like an overweight, smoking asthmatic in a game. I can run longer than this guy, and I was always the worst at running when I was in school. I thought he was a field agent. Or are field agents known for being unfit? Yes, I heard there's a perk that helps when you're higher level - but then most of the game would have been done which makes it academic. It's also stupidly miraculous when at Level 23, we gets knackered running for 1 minute.....Level 24 and you're suddenly a Kenyan in a marathon! I dislike this slightly darker screen that I get when I run so much that he gets tired. There's no need for it to signify that. I can see/hear he's out of breath by the lack of movement and deep breaths.  The last thing is another issue that's mainly to do with how I play again. As I play with the arrow keys, I mainly use one button to open the menu and cycle through it. I found I can press any of the buttons and the same button pressed again will close it AS LONG as you don't click into anything else - because then you are forced into pressing escape instead. This is a huge pain for me, because again, it forces me to move my entire arm to close the menu. Why can't there just be a ""menu"" button? Then I could open/close it with that, no matter what I used or clicked into. I actually liked how it feels to kill with a gun in this game. I've only just got one, so I don't know how much we get. But it would it been awesome if the game was to focus on this a lot more. The one thing I do dislike about it, however, is that there's no separate sensitivity for look/ADS. For my optimum sensitivity, the ADS speed should be half of how quick you can look around. This is far from it. It means I have to either have a stupidly hyper ""look"" speed to get my optimum aiming, or a really bad and slow aiming speed so that I can look around normally okay.  Personally, I can't stand the game at night time. I dislike that it forces me to play at night for some quests as well. This is more due to the fact that I'm playing it on my own, so all the enemies focus on me which results me in dying a lot. It wouldn't have been an issue if I didn't have to wait a month to get my physical release in the UK - now everyone on my Steam has already played it and moved on!  I like the graphics in it, but it does seem a bit choppy in places. I've found the movement with my mouse felt okay when I'm in some locations that aren't out in the world, but then it's weird/laggy when I go out. And my PC is pretty decent, so this shouldn't be happening.The last thing, is yet again this annoying durability on weapons. What is it with Techland and wrenches that can break? Make it logical. Maybe a wooden baseball bat would break after some time.......but I never found a wrench that ""breaks"" after hitting a load of people. Make the weapons more scarce in the world, if they don't break. I just can't stand losing a weapon when I'm fighting a number of zombies on my own. I would imagine weapons that have been modified could break easily, since it's being done in a mediocre fashion. But anything made fully of metal that's solid shouldn't break.Edited March 10, 2015 by Thy Majestie","Feature requests",1258
"1904","I fully agree with the OP's request for custom binding of keys even though I play on ps4.  I really appreciate the no fast travel though - more immersive.  (I only like the slums so I'm not counting fast travel between the two maps.). This is definitely a AAA game, and I can tell they're planning a sequel so feature requests are fair game.  I love this game!","Feature requests",1259
"1905","Well this is one of the reasons I play on PC rather than console for most games. I only get exclusives on console these days because I get annoyed that we can't change buttons on the controller either. I'd get too used to a button in one game and press it in another thinking it's the same thing. I lost count how many times I killed myself due to pressing sprint in one game, that's a grenade in the other. I guess I dislike the lack of fast travel because I'm having to play it on my own and the game becomes more boring playing it on your own a lot. I wasn't even aware there's another map, since I'm only a fifth of the way through it so far. It's just taking me ages to do because I keep dying with special zombies after me as well as the regular ones and I can't beat them on my own.","Feature requests",1260

The one thing I liked about this was the location for it.  Cross-platform play happened in the past with Shadowrun, but PC gamers were easily better than console ones which resulted in an artificial lag being introduced for them to ""even the odds"".

"1949","Dying Light really is a great game, I play co-op all the time with my friends and we have a blast. That said a few ideas had come to us while playing.1) The ability to craft a set number of items. For example crafting lots of medkits, lockpicks, flares...etc Is too time consuming doing one at time (or one bundle at a time). The option to craft say 20 medkits at one time (given I have all the materials) would be nice. Crafting these one at a time takes too much time away from the gameplay itself.2) The option to set the distance allowed in co-op to talk to a person of interest in a quest. I know there's already the fast travel and all but a lot of times its a pain when one or two people in co-op are trying to buy/sell their loot and the others are trying to turn in a quest but in order to turn in the quest you must have all players standing on top of each other. If an option to set the distance is no than at least make it so I can be within 10 feet of the area and not have to stand on top of each other to turn a quest in.3) Make the new DLC blueprints for weapons of your current level. I got the season pass and when the new weapons came out I couldn't wait to try them out but was really disappointed when the damage on these weapons don't even do 100 in damage. How can these be of any use when my regular weapons do 1000-1500 damage? I tried using a sledge hammer than did close to 1000 damage to craft one of the weapons and it brought the damage down to 86. If you can't have it stay with your current level then at least make it a little better than the weapon you use to craft it with.","Feature requests",1304

Some of my favorite quests were ones to just go and loot chupacabra, like finding the lighter fluid, took me 15 minutes of searching houses to find it, I liked that. These procedural quests could just be random loot items. Rather then having to voice over for quests, just have the quests posted on the bulletin board and hand them into the quarter masters. some examples of quests could be, lighter fluid, running low on canned goods, running low on water, clear out x amount of zombies in this neighborhood, rias' men turned off the water, re-open the valves, test out the new light trap on a volatile at night, need new bed linens for survivors, need medical supplies I could go on and on, just simple quests that take time to track down and complete.

Resetting traps during the day for example.   Maybe have a new type between human and viral who can be suppressed with constant supplies of antizen.  Otherwise those neighborhoods would turn.   Lastly, and maybe connected to these pre-viral types, maybe the GRE drops some kind of gas cloud over the area which sends those pre-vitals or biters into a raging pursuit.  This could lead to two interacting time cycles: day/night and the gas cloud drops. ","Feature requests",1310

"1959","I would just like to congratulate every single bit of effort that TechLand has put into this game! Its absolutely incredible! You should be so proud! Although I'm not a player of this game I am currently watching my boyfriend go through the story and I cant help but notice other city landscapes and bridges in the distance. Is this a little clue to extra maps? If so I think it would be a good idea that another small part of this dystopian world gets infected too but as Crane is now well established in fighting these zombies he can teach these citizens how to survive as well as fighting and free running as normal. I think travelling by plane or boat would be a good idea. Maybe Crane could rescue some people and bring them back to the slums/old town for them to live in the safe areas... I just think it could keep the game alive. I'm loving the idea of a multiplayer survival system where you physically board up areas and the strong the materials you bring the safer you are. I just think I would bring an interesting element to it and bring more Dying Light players together. Oh and one last thing! I love the idea of the screamers! But I think if those little buggers ran/crawled after you too, whilst screaming, would make the game play even more intense and interesting!  Yet again thankyou for this phenomenal game!

"1960","Dear Techland ,Regards to Dying Light , I would love to see a free play game where i can basically just roam around and pick up all weapons and just basically run around killing, killing , killing ! I  say this because every time i have my friends come over. they all have heard of this game but when they pick up and play they all say where are all the weapons. Once i tell them that you have to build them they play for abit.  but soon after they put the controller down. Im only suggesting this because even though myself i enjoy the way this game was made. It would be nice to just run around killing zombies , With all the weapons in the game you guys have provided ! Another idea for a gameplay would be called: KILL OR BE KILLED : basically you have 3 players in a small map, and you have like 3 minutes to kill the zombie before he kills all of you. So basically who ever wins the road gets a point . Up to 10.Zombies vs Humans gameplay : Where 5 vs 5 . Humans can use all weapons , Zombies can bite, use knives & jump. Night time would have a feature where your controller rumbles when a zombie gets close ! Lastly i saw the buggies it would be so cool to see a gameplay called : Zombie Derby or where you have 5-10 players in buggies and you have a health bar. You have to kill all the zombies on the track. The only thing is the zombies can jump on your buggie. To get them off or kill them other players have to hit your buggie or truck !  This would feature a Level  / Round gameplay system !Let Me Know What Everyone Thinks ! Good Night  Good Luck ! ","Feature requests",1315

"1974","I would really see more love given to firearms. Even Dead Island had more to offer. I especially miss the weapon upgrades, that allowed nifty effects to be added to the different firearms. What is also irritating is, that firearms have the very same stats, no matter if you have white ones, or even rare orange ones. It feels like firearms have been left uncompleted. Like they were rushed to be put it, but then left alone once functional. Meeting the gunsmith in Dying Light, i was like ""yeah great, finally something to do with firearms"", especially as the main character mentiones something about loving silencers are he learns about that person.Getting a melee weapon mod from this guy in the end, was possibly the biggest disappointment i felt in this game. From a gunsmith i expect firearm upgrades.. learning how to make a silencer that lasts a few shots and needs to be replaced (state of decay like). I feel that a lot of potential was ignored with the firearms. I loved guns in Dead Island, even though the focus there was also more on melee. Not to mention Dead Island Riptide, that allowed guns to shine even more. That there is no difference between white and orange weapons, and that there are no firearm mods at all, may be the big ""oh i sooo wished for that"" points for me.

"1998","Ideas And Feature Requests For Dying Light Developers.","Feature requests",1353
"1999","Most of my ideas are actually more suited to a Dying Light 2 as they're more structural and presentation improvements (hire me, Techland ) -Safehouses. Make it so there are no (or just a few) safehouses on the map. But allow players to turn any area or building into a safezone. This introduces strategy, not all spots are going to be as ideal or have everything you need.You'll have to make (or close) barricades, set up electricity and lighting, additional defenses, traps (all things you need scavenge and craft), gather weapons and supplies. At night a relentless attack of zombies (or Rais' men) that will whittle away at your barricades and defenses. This is especially great for co-op with friends and you can take the idea pretty far with allowing players to create crazy contraptions for traps and stuff! I'd play that for months.    -Story. I'm really on the fence about it. Parts of it I find really well done and enjoyable, but most of the main story so far has been pretty dull and predictable, tbh. Rais isn't an impressive villain. He's funny, but not cheesy enough to work as a funny villain. The arena scene cracked me up, I'm pretty sure that wasn't the intention. Crane as a protag also falls flat, he doesn't really seem to have a motivation other than just being sent there. But on the side of that main line, there are a lot of really cool ideas at work. The Harran as Olympic city is a brilliant hook you should've used more. Quests like the one where you meet Erol, or just random inhabitants or visitors are usually really cool. That's where you get a glimpse of the city that Harran once was and what has happened since. Personally, that has much more of an impact that Rais' ramblings about being a real man or monkey or whatever  Basically, don't do the monologueing villain unless you're prepared to go all the way with the 90's action movie shlock and really ramp up the cheese factor. I don't think this is the game for it. The hardcore survival angle is much more appealing and exploring a ghost town never gets old (think Bioshock, Fallout, Alien Isolation), but the magic there is in integrating layers of story telling into the gameworld.. Show, don't tell. Consider readable logs a cop out, and audiologs a high production value cop out. The game is at it's best when you're exploring the city and stumbling upon small signs of life or little stories. Leave room for that. One of the very best things about Dying Light is all the different gameplay styles (and rhythms) you can choose from and the open-ended approach to missions. Running across rooftops, or methodically scouring through every building for supplies (or quests), stealth or full on assault. Guns or melee. I think that's strong enough to drive a game that maybe doesn't have a tight plot, but is really more about exploring the place and well.. surviving it. In fact, why the whole GRE angle with Crane.. Ironically I would find him much more interesting if he was just a random guy from Harran. Mohammed the plumber or something. Average dude, maybe with a family, with a normal job that is faced with a zombie outbreak and slowly sees the city he grew up in change into a living version of hell. Neighbours turn into zombies, or turn on him once supplies get scarce. He's not concerned with unmasking the global corporate conspiracy which may or may not be behind the outbreak and/or trying to profit from it.. he's just concerned with surviving and keeping his friends and family safe! Small drama like that is much more impactful, because people can relate to it, especially if it all unfolds from a first person perspective. It also saves you having to do a lot of empty exposition to explain the larger plot... don't explain it. Much, much scarier that way. Keep it small.  Take TLoU. What makes that story work so well is that Joel fundamentally doesn't really care that much about the main mission or the politics of the world (fireflies vs. government..bla bla.. he's just a guy trying to make do and wanting to be left alone). The situation then kind of forces him into the mission with Ellie, which then keeps going because of their growing and rather awkward relationship, which in turn allows him to come to terms with the loss of his daughter long ago... that is the real meat of that story. Everything else is just backdrop and because it is, it doesn't always have to make sense or be fully explained. Like the moment with the giraffes.. it's beautiful because it just happens.  Gameplay-wise. I know Dying Light has caught some slack for being derivative and using familiar gameplay systems from other games. I think that's actually a major strong point. The game is about survival and thinking on your feet. The game just hands you a very large toolbox, gives you an objective and asks you to figure it out. It's important that the tools are predictable and work like you would expect from your experience with other games. So I think you should laugh off any such critcisms and add even more stuff that's vaguely familiar from other games. Originality is vastly overrated and comes from things like presentation and story anyway.  As smaller additions: vehicles are really nice. Weaponized vehicles even better... think Mad Max. Maybe not just cars, which are of limited use in a cramped city, but smaller things like motorcycles, scooters and even cycles (i'm dutch, i can't help myself) which you can sortof use inside the city.  Countryside... love that in GTA how you can go from middle of the city to complete wilderness.  Smart stacking and multi-tracking of mission objectives. Fetch quests are great in a game like this, essential, but I want to be able to track more of them so I can pick them up when I happen to be in the area. Make it a less an icon-chase. More missions and that tie into the day/night cycle, happen at specific times, must be completed before.. .etcMore missions that have a visible or at least tangible effect on the world. It's cool to see your work having a positive effect on the world and the survivors around you. There's already a fair bit of that with the various sidequests but it could be expanded on.  Anyway.. that's about enough for now... have that patch ready first and maybe we'll talk more.  Off to enjoy some sunshine...tadaah!","Feature requests",1354
"2000","Make really a hardcore mode where at night is really hard to survive if you're out at night, you should be aware of the risk, with the current complexity of the game you can easily escape from his pursuers. You need to create an atmosphere of survival, fear for their own lives, today it is all missing. You added a new difficulty mode is not that complicated, still easy to get away from the chase. I hope you will listen.

"2001","I agree with others on this forum that if during multiplayer you get separated from the group you are in trouble, thus forcing you to work as a team. Something else that I think can improve the game is the inventory menu. As it stands right now its just a menu that we have to navigate and feels kinda detached from the character we are playing. I think it would be better that when we press ""I"" the character takes off a backpack of some sort and we have to navigate the various pockets for the items we are looking for. An example would be like the large pocket would be for weapons where as side pockets would be for loot we pick up. Also please find a way to make nighfall gameplay more of a key component to the game. Force the players to stay out at night to complete missions or make it more difficult for us to get to safe zones. As it stands right now its too easy to skip the night gameplay.","Feature requests",1356
"2002","Dying light is an amazing game, But there is some things that i've realised would make the game a lot better:*New Guns, Especially SNIPERS and RPGs! â€‹*Weapon customisation, Red dot sights, silencers etc! *A REWARD for completing ALL SIDE QUESTS, like a special outfit or some crazy new weapons! I was really disappointed when i didn't receive anything for all my effort and time i spent on doing this! This should really already be in the game!*A PvP gamemode unlocked after the main story where you can hold up in buildings and fight against, not only the infected but other players! E.g when you die you drop all your stuff and people can loot your body etc (Almost like the DayZ Standalone game on steam) I undersand this would be a lot of work for techland but i think it would make the game one million times better, And would also hook in a lot more players! The reason i believe this mode should be unlocked after completing the story, is that i think its pretty essential to have completed the story if you were going to play a gamemode like this! *New map? This is something i wouldn't be to surprised about being a DLC. I think it would be amazing to have a little change in scenery for a little extra money! Slums and OT get pretty boring after a while! So a small, fun map with some bonus quests would be great!If Techland see this, i want you to know, Congratulations on what you have created and you should feel proud as heck to say you developed this game! The suggestions above are (like i said) suggestions that WILL bring more players to the game, and for me, the PvP gamemode would be amazing, as an xbox player, there isn't a game or gamemode on any console game like that (i dont think)! PS if the PvP gamemode does get created, please dont make it for PC only. Also, i'd be happy to pay extra money for this gamemode, or maybe if it was a DLC package that comes out in future with the season pass! Thanks for reading! I really appreciate! (You may have seen this same -or similar- post(s) on this forum and others, they are all by me, they are just drafts that i have  ""Updated"")Edited March 16, 2015 by MyNameIsLegendEU","Feature requests",1357

"2008","I was going to suggest repeatable missions such as find a person, kill a zombie, or even more advanced ones. thus when you finish the mainline tasks and even side quests you can do more stuff. Absolutely, give zombie bosses in which you can ""go on the hunt"" sorta speak and get a special reward if you kill it, and return to the person wanting an item a zombie had. For example: If you were to go see the quartermaster, he had a Kill Order on a Super Goon (random name), it would tell you the name of the monster, and what item he has in order for your payment. Or simply just a kill confirm type thing where you harvest a body part or even its head!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MY IDEA:  Also, I would like to see BOUNTIES added to this game. I have been thinking, if someone out of 4 survivors, or bump the limit up to 6 survivors, someone can place a bounty on a player and Survivor-Pvp is then automatically turned on. Anyone can hurt/kill the person with the bounty, but once the bounty is claimed, one of the other survivors can steal it by killing YOU! If you dont want the bounty, immediately vacate the area! This will not include you from the ""bounty challenge"" and automatically survive the day/night. If you do have a bounty, you can either make it to an extraction zone and if you make it their alive, you leave the game with bonus xp/money/new weapon possibly.  NOTE: Place a bounty on a player you do not want in the game, once the bounty is placed and they are hunted down and killed, they leave the game automatically, just like the Night Hunter.","Feature requests",1363

"2015","Here is what I would like to see: 1. Have the night zombies react heavily if they see your flashlight. Shine that light on a pack of zombies and they will immediately start to head your way, with a purpose.2. Have the Volatiles have a very slight ""glow"" to them. Similar to when you shine the UV light on them, but not that bright of a glow. Just a little. This way if you want to go completely stealth at night and skip the flashlight, at least you will be able to see them. You will need to be close to them and have a clean line of site, but at least if you take your time and slowly sneak around you will be able to avoid them. Maybe make this a toggle option that you can turn on or off in the menu.3. Make the flashlights have a cost to use them. You find batteries around Harran, have the flashlight use those up. Each battery give you 10 minutes of run time. If you dies you must use another to power it. If you do not have any more then you better do a better job of scavenging around. This will help enhance the scavenger and crafting aspects of the game.4. Give each booster a different color icon. Then when you have them in your inventory you can easily see what is up in the HUD. Right now the icon is just a green bottle so you have not real way to differentiate what exactly you will be consuming. This means you have to go into your inventory to see what is there and maybe move things around. Hard mode has made the boosters a very nice addition to this game.

Maybe increasing the difficulty of night time and making the nightrunners ""Smarter"" would make people more aprehensive about playing at night. Also another thing I have a problem with for awhile now is the power you have to ""choose"" whether it's night or day by simply sleeping like whenever. This bothers me because it takes away from the anxiety you feel for finishing up what you are doing during the day before it becomes night when all you have to do is sleep when its getting night, making it night, then sleeping again to make it day time. As if a human being can sleep whenever they wants to. I believe that taking away the option of ""sleeping"" whenever you want to change the day to night and vice versa will improve the game a lot and increase the importance and fear of night time. For example, making it so your character gets exuasted is the only time he can sleep. Or rather forced to sleep, this would make it so that if its day time and your character gets tired and needs to sleep or his combat and agility suffers, will force a player to suddenly play at night time.

I believe it would give us players ""adrenaline kicks"" and gets us in the mood too continue, almost like Dead Space. Of a short comparison to Dead Space, it included many jump scares. What my other addition to ark7th's post is to have different zombie grabs as well. Make some zombies, say the virals, run and tackle you to the ground, almost like the volatile at night. Also, have the Bolter defend itself! Give it some sort of attack instead of just running away. That's all my ideas for now, when I think of something later, I will post it as soon as possible.  Remember, if you cannot make it to the Tower in time, get to the nearest safe house and wait until dawn. GOOD NIGHTGOOD LUCK ","Feature requests",1393

"2042","What I would like to see in game would be:1. To have a Crossbow- so to have a silent long ranged weapon.2. Suppressors for Guns ***3. A wider variety of guns- Like an AA12 or other tactical shotguns, Desert Eagle, Revolvers, SMGs like a MP5 etc.***4. A housing system like Skyrim, where you can get a house, fortify it, move things around to decorate, show case weapons you find or you can     even make it so your room that you have on the upper level of the Tower in the Slums is customizable and you can hang rare weapons on         the wall, place collectibles and decorate you room and things like that.***5. More Glow in the Dark Outfits6. More sidequests7. A Game Mode where you have a hunger and thirst meter I don't expect some of these to get implemented but I just thought it would be good to get my thoughts out there!Edited March 20, 2015 by ThatGodlyFellow","Feature requests",1397

"2056","Hi there, I just wanna add some suggestions that came to my mind. 1. Executionmoves - I don't know if this is hard to make, but since most of the weapons, especially when modded, look brutal as f*ck, I think it would be awesome to do sick some execution moves with them. 2. That is more a problem. The weapons from the DLCs are useless when you play the game a while. Even if you build a 600dmg hammer to a speacial DLC weapon, the new weapon only does about 80dmg. That should be changed in my opinion. Otherwise awesome game, on of the best in the last years. Good job !!","Feature requests",1411

Even worse, he will try and run up the wall when I try and grab the ledge and then jump off the building entirely and plummet to his death. I've probably lost around 50,000 survivor points from this alone, not to mention death that have occurred from trying to grab a ledge and he simply won't perform the action.

"2064","Dying Light needed a bigger map based on the dynamic of the slums. Old Town didn't work for me. There were also too many of those green exploding zombies in Old Town that weren't bloaters.. I didn't get the option to explore and know Old Town because virals kept on getting attracted to green exploding zombies and interupting my momentum. A more agreeable main character (one that simply doesn't burn away life-saving Antizin) would have been a little better. The player's personal bedroom in the tower should have been on the lower level. The momentos in the bedroom gave the game a little soul it needed, but I don't go up the elevator to the upper levels and into the bedroom because I have no reason to. Exploding lure bombs that actually kill zombies.  That's it. The game was well put together, and not a dissapointment like most other games coming out about now.","Feature requests",1419
"2065","Alright this might be a little rant, before i go any further i just want to say that i love this game i have played more then 100 hours in it its a marvelous game and i will continue to play it ,with that being said there are some features that i would like to see looked at. First being i was very let down to see that bows were not implemented into the game ( i do now they will) i hope they come with a DIY arrow system where you make arrows out of laying around lumber or cut a tree branch which will attract unwanted attention and the tail end of the arrow made out of plastic or something like that, as well as that i would to obviously see DIY arrow tips ie exploding and toxin tip that you have to ether dip into bolter blood or plants what ever one works better. i was also shocked to see that i was using swords so quickly and axes without using the simple glass on a tree branch which would be a little more survival type item. The crafting system in the game is good but lacking on the realism but even if we don't like realism and we went to the ""no way"" items there still inst a lot to the crafting system unfortunately. Now on to the biggest issue i have, the guns there are everywhere and ammo is so plentiful the guns seem so be lack luster the stores have can fill your ammo up everyday on normal and they don't degrade? Lets face it they should then it wouldn't be so bad picking them up every where. I wish the vendors in the stores only sold 10 bullets every 7 days making the player use the ammo in a very conservative manner something alone the lines of i only have 4 bullets left for 5 days i'm about to die and there are 4 zombies blocking my path to this safe house i could kill them which in turn would clear the path but i would attract more with the shots and i wouldn't have ammo for the rest of the week type of situation, going on from here the mods of the guns or lack there of why do we rescue a gunsmith if we cant get him to make us a suppressor or scope or a grenade launcher?Now moving on the zombies, first off the biters need to form hordes of 15- 30 making it a challenge to get away after you kill that alone zombie. Virals should me more engaging not just staying 10 feet away screaming waiting for the player to loot turn around and kill it when a explosion goes off ( Ie exploding arrow tips) 3-5 virals should as a pack jump you now this should be an event not every explosion will do it make it a chance on explosion type thing. Screamers and bloater are awesome the should be out more and the Screamers ( the crying babies) should hide and play off as a kid more the crying tends to give em a way have them hide in homes in open able closets so as you open boom screamer or bloaters . the goons and demos are for the most part avoidable and that is a shame, if you remember the kill the troll side quest how that demo bashed through the wall to fight you i would like to see them bashed through walls near crates and only sometimes obviously  making the player leave or kill it i would be cool to see these zombies be more in the players face make moment to moment reaction that are run or stand and have a good possibility of death unless you have a plan . Now on to Volatiles they should chase you in homes ( not the safe housed of course) but normal windows and doors in homes tend to lose them like they are mindless, make the player feel like they need to have a plan all the time the mindless game play is what a hate once you reach max level with these weapons the infected become a joke hard mode should be how they are in normal and hard mode get more dangerous ones. Now on the the night hunter ...this creature should be the biggest threat to the player every 3-5 in game night these creatures that are AI controlled will appear from there nest to feed on what ever they can find humans or zombies they don't care they are predators fast, completely silent and far more deadly then anything the player has faced they do no show on the map and your sense cannot detect them in normal or hard they come out in a pack of 4 that split in to pairs to hunt they have a bigger resistance to UV light but are still harmed by it. They are more intelligent then the Volatiles they will smash down doors attack safe houses you have acquired that would have to go and board back up and once they see you they will hunt you till you get to a safe house then they run off so you cant pull the sitting on the edge of the fence on a safe house and still shoot trick ( needs to be fixed) they mainly will feed on the bigger threats to the player like demos , goons, bolters , and Volatile leavening the biters alone unless their desperate. Now the name night hunter is already used so they would need a new name obviously . Im stop this ranting and sorry for the wall of text now i have more ideas i just want to see what you guys think of these so far if you like it i can always share more i would love to see more reasons to fear the night hopefully this will help.","Feature requests",1420

They would be limited so you would have to conserve them and aiming may be terrible for you and some others but for me and pretty much anyone i know that owns this game,the aiming system is fine its not Call of duty type game but its very easy to get head shots from a distance or even up close.

Hence why i would like to see the limit in place, with it set in place and used effectively the gun still is good for long range clear outs of Rais men from crates without the need to endanger the player and waste med kits and resources. Fewer bullets should in return push the player to go for a one shot kill. this also get guns back up there with these powerful melee weapons.

Your basically saying that because you can make ""bomb out of mushrooms and alcohol"" its out of the realm of possibility, yet fertilizer bombs are a real thing that can even destroy cars but in a game i think the plants are easier to carry around in my opinion... Then you go on to say not to use weapons ? So your logic removes the other half just like you said i did who dont use guns. In Normal bullets are too common a simple fix to that is make it like hard mode and you have to find them. If you dont like my idea that is fine but come up with something better ""make an ammo blueprint"" for what ? in a Zombie apocalypse your going to have the resources and the tools to make bullets that can fire out of modern day weaponry ? No. I would love to see that type of logic for shotgun shell since you can fire a shot gun shell with razor blades even in it but to ask for a blueprint to make ammo when its already in abundance is not needed personally.

Your basically saying that because you can make ""bomb out of mushrooms and alcohol"" its out of the realm of possibility, yet fertilizer bombs are a real thing that can even destroy cars but in a game i think the plants are easier to carry around in my opinion... Then you go on to say not to use weapons ? So your logic removes the other half just like you said i did who dont use guns. In Normal bullets are too common a simple fix to that is make it like hard mode and you have to find them. If you dont like my idea that is fine but come up with something better ""make an ammo blueprint"" for what ? in a Zombie apocalypse your going to have the resources and the tools to make bullets that can fire out of modern day weaponry ? No. I would love to see that type of logic for shotgun shell since you can fire a shot gun shell with razor blades even in it but to ask for a blueprint to make ammo when its already in abundance is not needed personally. Once again i dont mind you or anyone else questioning my ideas but if you going to go off and say they are stupid then by all mean come up with a better idea or state why they really wouldn't work.You keep talking like ammo is supper easy to find when its not ...altho im playing hard mode sry ur not there but in hard mode u cant buy it and maby 1 out of evey 20 of raises men have guns... and absolutly 0 npc's carry shot guns so any 1 who has a shot gun will never get ammo .. maby once u actual beat super easy kiddy mode and go to hard mode ull see.

This would add some realism to the game, a new level of challenge, a strong reason to explore and venture out rather than just waiting at the safe house till morning.As well make it so the food that players pick up slowly rots over time, so there's no point in stocking up food to have a near unlimited supply and not care about looking for food again. There should be a penalty of some sort for dying whether it be all your supplies drop to where you die thus requires the player to run back to pick it up before it despawns to losing a portion of their hunger or to find medicine to heal themselves otherwise suffer from a movement penalty ie. half speed movementCo dependency with other players would make it really fun!

"2108","I love the game, I really do. This game has more of a realistic feel than many other zombie games I've played. However it doesn't feel like the normal zombies have that zombie type of feel. A bite from a zombie should infect (as seen at the beginning of the game) and give some type of consequence for the bite (such as the sporadic loss of stamina throughout the story mode).     If a mechanic could be implemented (even a simple one) that makes it so you can't take zombie bites to the neck over and over without consequence,  or without some type of cure, that would make this game feel even more realistic than it already is.     My idea is to make it so a bite ""reinfects"" the player until he or she gets a cure for that bite. The first bite doesn't require urgent care (incase your doing a retrieving mission and slip up or something of the sort) however it still gives side affects depending on how many times you've been bitten or how long you've left a bite un-attended. Such as: One bite= Very rare cases of instant stamina loss. Lasting for a very short amount of time.  Two bites (or 5 minutes of leaving a bite untreated)= Rare cases of instant stamina loss. Lasting for a short period of time. Three to four bites (or 10 minutes of leaving a bite untreated)= frequent cases of instant stamina loss. Lasting for a normal period of time. Five bites (or 15 minutes of leaving a bite untreated): Very frequent cases of instant stamina loss. Last for a long period of time.  Six bites ( or 25 minutes of leaving a bite untreated)= Instant stamina loss, lasting until treated. Seven bites ( or 30 minute of leaving a bite untreated)= causes death. I don't know if this is something that would be completely impossible to put in, but I honestly think that this would make it so players make smarter choices when choosing to either run through a valley of undead, or when choosing to take a safer, longer route.    The cure to these bites/effects could be crafted with specific materials or bought at the store for a certain amount of money, or obtained with once every certain amount of days from the quarter master, or found in supply drops that give medical items. The idea would be to make it so players conserve these ""cures"" and can't amass or stockpile them inside of their inventory. It also makes it so players can't just hack and slash themselves to victory and actually have to take a better look at when to just run through mobs of zombies and when to take smarter options.   Even without this feature the game is amazing, and I look forward to every other update that you guys have to offer.","Feature requests",1463

"2116","Hey, guys. My friend and I decided on a whim to buy Dying Light, knowing very little about it. We heard it was good and we haven't had that go-home-and-play-together-for-hours experience with a game since we were kids, so we were very excited. I would like to thank you for a great experience, as Dying Light did not disappoint. Last night was our first and, so far, only play session. We are just under 4 hours into the game and we are loving it. We do both, however, have one gripe. Ideally, we would be able to split up and clear a building room by room, or one of us could distract a mob of zombies and the other could sneak in and loot a van, or one of us could play overwatch and cover the other's back during an infiltration. Unfortunately, if we want to get all the loot from a building, we both have to search every room. This mechanic really takes us out of the game from an immersion perspective. The ability to share loot, and lootables being ""first come, first serve"" (for lack of a better term), we feel, are necessary mechanics to make this game the best game it can be. Thanks for your consideration, and a great game,  Dakota","Feature requests",1471

This would diversify everyones game greatly and would also add a touch of personalisation to each persons character, your own place to call home as such.

Make us panic when our Food and Water levels drop, make it deplete our stamina faster, and most of all, WEAKEN US! Nothing scares me more than having something fundamental, an integral part of the game (such as Parkour or Melee) that I've gotten used to, taken away from me! I love Dying Light, it's one of my favourite games at the moment,Keep at it guys ","Feature requests",1481
"2127","The game is incredible, guys. I have the Xbox One version and I am having trouble putting the controller down. It's been a long while since a game did that for me. I have a couple ideas I would love to see in action, others may have posted these as well. Survival Mode: Users can chose from several specific sites to defend, including rooftops (the roof of Rais' base would be GREAT), and the infected come in waves up to at least Wave 50 (similar to Gears of War - each Wave is a bit more intense and zombie packed, then the zombies grow stronger or more plentiful every 10 you complete). Furthermore, you have toggles in the settings to indicate which types of zombies you would like to include/exclude, and even ratios for the appearance of the different types. Evasion Mode: Just like running at night, with Virals and Volatiles on your tail and other types of zombies scattered about, but you cannot ever lose them - they ALWAYS knows where you are. You have to keep moving, and go for as long as you can evade them. No weapons, only Grappling Hook, UV Flashlight, Flares and Night Vision, Stamina and Speed potions. All of these items on toggles, to include/exclude them, Flares and Potions have to be picked up at blips on the map to re-supply. You can restock just by running over them (just like with the Pistol ammo when you have the Pistol equipped in the main game - get get right next to it and he automatically picks it up. Destination Mode: Exactly the same as above, only you are moving from Safe House to Safe House, and you have to reach every one on the map to ""win"" - zombies get more plentiful and aggressive as you reach each check point. I would play all of these modes for hours. And other cool factors could be added in - these are just the basics. Hope to see these someday!","Feature requests",1482

"2133","Hello Techland Team and Community.I am a Female Gamer and i realy love the Game Dying Light and its Immersive Gameplay Perspective. I say that cause many People Believe Woman do not like or play Game s like that...But i found some Cliping Issues with the Animations in Version 1.5.0.When you Climb around and hang and turn fast from Left to Right or Right to Left the Body turns to slow and you can see actualy a Perspective No Neck no Head Cliping.And when you look down and hit exhausted with your 2 Handed Weapon an Enemy, you can see this Problem too like a Hole in Your Chest, where your Neck actualy is. This Problem is when you expand the Sight of View to 20 in the Options Menu Game.And when you push Yourself up to Leap more High, when you hang on a Wall and look down fast at the same Time, Invisible Neck Head Cliping. I know it is almost inpossible or should be ""haha"" to see your own Neck in Reality.May you could Fix this Problem. That you can not see your own Neck with its invisible Hole, that whould make the Game much more realistic, the Other Animations seem to have no Problems, no Matter what Sight of View 0 or 20 and no Cliping. I prefer to play with 20 Sight of View, cause you can see much more of the actual Body, what is much more Immersive. Apology for my realy weird English sometime s. I may do a Video to show the Animation Bug s Cliping Issues later.If someone can Fix this Problem later with a Mod or something whould be good to, but it is a shame the Game is almost Perfect for First Person Perspective by far the best i play so for Immersion. I found more little Cliping and Texture Problems in the Slums Map, but nothing to serious but i guess you Guys work hard to patch the Game : ) Thanks for Dying Light Techland Developers. RinXair <3 ..Edited March 28, 2015 by RinXair","Feature requests",1488
"2134","Great job on the game I have already beat this game and am working on the hard mode right now here are some suggestions that I have that I think would improve the game. First I think there should be more diversity with guns and weaupons.

Another thing is I think you threw away the idea of the survival aspect to have to get food and water to early once I beat the game(requests included along with the quarantines) there wasn't much to do except for finding the last blueprints and maxing out my character. I feel like if there was a survival aspect it would give the player something else to do but I think this aspect should be limited to a more difficult game mode mentioned previously in a comment hardcore mode. The last thing I want to mention is the idea of your safe zone be raided either by the last of rais's men or the infected. It would be cool to be out searching for stuff then a distress call comes out and you need to go save them. What would be even more impressive would to have that happen while you're inside a safe house imagine that you get to a safe house thinking your safe and while you're trading items all of a sudden a demolisher comes ramming the side of the safe house making so much noise it brings more zombies along with goons that eventually knocks down the fence witch you would have to repair to get the safe house back that would be terrifying to know that no where you hide is safe.

"2141","I'd like to see a blueprint to craft more thrown weapons than just the stars.  Or at least enable the DIY throwing knives recipe that so many guides say you get after the ""First Assignment"" mission. Going elemental-ninja style is great and all, but the blades required for the stars seem to be very low on the loot-spawning list. Not to mention their damage is so nerfed as to not be very effective against anything. (Even the night hunter.) As for the elemental stars. Any chance of throwing some toxic ones there in place of exploding?  I mean, yeah, it's cool watching the undead get blown to bits from a little thing that hits their chest, but it's really not very practical given that it draws in virals like the explosive barrel. Yes, I realize that's the intended effect, but it doesn't even kill the zed that was hit and there's no aoe to compensate for that. Also, MOAR GUNZZZZ! I know, this contradicts what I said about the exploding throwing stars, but the sniper rifle in Dead Island: Riptide made grabbing rifle ammo actually worth it. Maybe throw in some blueprints to craft regular and specialized ammo too? I get the feeling explosive bullets would actually be semi-useful. x3 Now, for something a bit more crucial to gameplay.  Could you fix the lag spikes and freezing when the zombies grab the player? Specifically for those running GeForce GTX graphics units at least?","Feature requests",1496

"2144","Hey guys! I really like the be the zombie thing, and I realized something. I love the game itself, but i have nothing else to do now. So i play be the zombie, only for the PvP. Same for any other game: you finished the campain, you start the PvP. It's kinda sad that the only way you can play PvP is by the be the zombie mode. And to be honest, it's not so much work to create some other simple PvP modes! We don't want something huge, we just want a PvP mode we can play for long without beeing bored. We want a mode where we can find teamates easily and play a game of 15 minutes then do it again. So I got an idea. I called it ''Community deathmatch (CDM)'' for now, but there is so many way to call it. -You join it while you are in-game, its in the matchmaking settings. You can select the mode and it will match you with one of the servers of the mode. -A server is 100 players (50 in each team). When a server is full, another start filling up, so there is always full games. When you join the PvP match, you can still play in your game until the server is filled with 30 players: then the game starts and other players can join later. -The map would be the ''be the zombie'' map. It is not really used for now, and it is kinda small, perfect for this PvP mode. -The objective is simple: each team of 50 start in a big safe zone, at opposite sides of the map. When the game starts, you have your own inventory, but the weapon's durability isn't used (same as invasion mode). 10 supplies houses are around the map. These houses gives medkits, weapons and boosters. Your team needs to work together to get these houses and make them safe zones. If you encounter someone of the opposite team, his name will appear in red and all your team will see it throught walls as long as you do. You can kill your opponents. If you die, you respawn in the nearest safe zone you have unlocked. Day/Night cycle is still working but 2 times faster (so there is like 3 days per game). Each team got 500 lives. If you lose your last life, the ennemy team win. If you want to win faster, you have to move forward and take the safe zones of the ennemy team. Finnally, if you destroy the ennemy base's generator, all the UV lamps of their base close and their is an animation of night crawlers killing everyone. -Rewards would be XP, weapons (and even gold ones), loot and unique things. -When the game finishes, you are back to your normal game and you may join another game. So, this game would be like an invasion mode (not talking about the be the zombie invaasion): you rush forward in small groups of 8-10, you try to be sneaky and take the safe zones. You steal the safe zones of the ennemy team and you work in team to kill them all by taking strategic outposts. You finnally try to get inside their base (the big safe zone) and destroy the generator. If you did, you have to keep it destroyed until night, because you only win if the night crawlers invade their base. If its day, you have to focus on protecting the destroyed generator with your team (because the ennemy team can repare it by day). That's what i thought about. I think it would be nice to have a game mode like this... whatever if you want it to be released i think we can do it if we are a large amount of players wanting it. So if you guys want this PvP game mode just like this reply and share this! It would really be fun to have it, so i need your help guys. A little help of all of you and together techland will see us and maybe listen to what we want ","Feature requests",1499
"2145","Hello everyone, I've maxed out my character and after hours of gameplay I have only three POSSIBLE changes/additions to the game for now. 1. Bringing back the Air DROPs. Maybe after the player has completed the story line, the GRE would call Crane on his phone and try and convince Crane to hand over the disease data file, but Crane sees this as an opportunity to milk the GRE into giving him what he wants for the Tower. He threatens to destroy the file unless they resume supply drops, so the GRE listens to his threat and resumes the DROPs, this would give people something to do after the game which can be very full-filling. 2. Bringing back the Antizin DROPs, a possible addition to the 1st request are Antizin DROPs, it would make sense that the Tower would still need Antizin after DROPs stopped so this helps the story after the main storyline is finished and they come back the same way the regular DROPs did (by Crane threatening to destroy the file the GRE want.) These Antizin DROPs contain the obvious and give the player more survivor points, but because of the value and importance; Rais' men often get their first or are dropped in hard to reach places. 3. Finally, their should also be weapons that come with air DROPs if they are brought back into the game. My reason for these ideas to be implemented is that the game can be so much rewarding if they are introduced. Number 1 helps to give players something to do if they are maxed out but lower levels an extra option to level up. Number 2 helps with the story line in which Antizin is still needed at the Tower and gives the players a bigger challenge in getting to them first and finally number 3 helps maxed out people because they have no need for Supply on-site packages so weapons can be more beneficial. Plus I think everyone loves the feeling of getting to an air DROP first before Rais does. I Hope you took the time to read these suggestions and thank you for listening.  Kind regards, B0dyC0unter.   ","Feature requests",1500

The hud should have an option to turn off and like everyone is saying the zombies should get stronger as your weapons do overtime. Also there shouldnt be one hit kill weapons. If weapons are able to have like 2000 for power and you can kill everything with one hit then this game isnt really action/survival because your not worried anymore about surviving, since your weapons kill everything.","Feature requests",1504

A place where we can go only at a specific hour or interval where we can find a zombie boss guarded by other zombies of course, that requires a full party to kill, and the ones that can kill the BOSS get a well deserved loot of special limited weapons.

"2157","I think a fun idea to implement to the game is to give perks to outfits when worn. For example (not to be expected as described--but just to get an idea): Fresh Clothes = NOTHING. You're new, kid... gain some more experience.Athlete = Increased staminaRunner = Increased run speed/durationScout = Increased climbing speed; increase rifle/bow range/damage (when bows come into the game!)Survivor = Increase the speed to use medkits and their healing effects; increase potion effects/durationsHeadhunter = Increase co-op players' (and self) health and stamina by a small fraction (+25?)Juggernaut = Increased charge damage and distance enemies are thrown; +50 health DLC:Ninja = Increased crouch speed; softer landing (from taller heights); increase throwing star damageSpecial Agent = Ability to dual-wield pistols; Increase pistol ammunition capacity (hurry up and bring silencers to game!)Urban Explorer = Increase environmental damage to enemies; Increase rifle damage National Outfits = Increase own health +25 I think this will not only give players the ability to ""think"" they look cool (since we can't see ourselves in the game and these outfits are really meant more for co-op), but make the selection of a specific outfit feel beneficial for the player, based on their desired play style or perk they'd enjoy. It would definitely make future outfits interesting in order allow new or additional perks such as: *Dual-wield one-handed melee weapons*Increase vehicular driving skills--when they become implemented in game! Not sure how this one would work, but it's an idea.*Grappling hook pulls enemies to you.*Allow ability to block with weapon (costs durability? can only block other melee attacks but not two-handed weapon attacks or charges/pounces)*Faster shotgun reloading/increase shotgun ammo capacity*Fist attacks/kicking do more damage Etc.... Make outfits more than a cosmetic thing for other players to enjoy!!!   ","Feature requests",1512
"2158","To OP who well detailed a good scheme for using costume choice for rpg like runner-builds.  To this suggestion, I'd like to add.  Please use the same musician to do the sequel's score: it made the game very very immersive and emotional for me - the moog brought me back to classic trippy horror films.  Next, please add the ability to fortify any or many structures as a safe house.  Daily repairs and improved fortifications are regularly necessary.  Add some ubisoft like paid cosmetic and also functionally important upgrades to the self-chosen fortified apartment to give a reason to pour time/XP/money to improve a runners daily life.   Add the hunger/thirst cycle.  Daily subsistence and farming/gathering make this also a daily de-compression after-work option.  Not to memtion give a reason for player/co-op trading.  Finally, make this harder than HellBorne game.

Make supply drops change up so it isn't always med kits and flares, perhaps ammo and throw-able weapons could be implemented. 4. Flashlight battery meter, I notice it tends to die out at least on hard mode, a meter would be nice. 5. After reaching the max lvl why not get rid of the lvl meter on the top of the screen. 6.

"2163","Me again. This is more for ""Be the Zombie"" mode but, maybe implement something to make the players that get killed into volatiles or night walkers when there are less or just as many lives as players, and of course make it so this can be opted out of. Or just make it another game mode entirely so there's less chance of some scared chupacabra quitting as soon as someone invades. This is for everything. Could you take away the ""all players must have the same mods"" bullcrap? It's just making it hard to play with other people and doesn't really prevent cheating at all. And finally, if the ""survival mode"" thing ever comes to fruifion, could you also make it so you need to find antizin as well? Given that Crane was bitten at the beginning it seems like a part of gameplay with a lot of potential that was just ignored. Maybe make it so a lack of antizin will impact your gameplay in either a positibpositive or negative way? Like recent factors determining if you get some form of mutation from it? No mutation equals the usual no-stamina slugishness as well as less resistance to attacks and elemental damage, there could be a toxic mutation that makes you give off noxious fumes (quit giggling, you ten-year-olds), or maybe just give the mutations the effects of the in-game boosters, but to where you die if you go too long without antizin. Just a few thoughts on how to implement it.Edited April 8, 2015 by SeekerofDarkness13","Feature requests",1518

"2165","Firstly the weapon modifications seem a bit lazy. They all basically have the same requirements.  One of the things I liked about Dead Island was some of the simpler weapon mods like wrapping barbed wire around a baseball bat which stood out as unique. None in Dying Light stand out to me. Out of all the blueprints most are the same except they can be used on different weapons. Maybe add a knife sharpener which can be found and used to sharpen a knife or machete giving it more damage, but limit it to only a couple of uses so you will have to find a separate one to do the mod again. I'm sure there are other people with more suggested modifications.  My second suggestion is to add dual-wield single handed weapons. Maybe make it an unlockable in the power skill tree. There is only 24 levels at the moment so why not add it and make it up to 25. You could have it so with dual wielding you could attack twice as fast but at the expense of losing stamina twice as fast as well so it would be balanced, and then when you reach level 25 and get the skill that means you never get tired, change it so that you never get tired when wielding one weapon but you still do when dual wielding just maybe at a slower rate. With this you could add some new takedown animations such as dual wielding 2 hammers you would swing one at either side of a zombies head, crushing it or with 2 knives use them like scissors to cut a zombies head off.  Although I wouldn't limit it to dual wielding 2 of the same weapon so you could have a blade in one hand and a hammer in the other. Maybe a takedown animation for this could be to stab the zombie in the chest and hold it in place then smash it's head in from the top with the hammer.  Third suggestion is to bring back Knuckledusters from Dead Island. They were great. Not all that damaging but very fast to get in quick hits just to knock zombies back and then of course modding them to make them more powerful.","Feature requests",1520

"2170","I've got a few ideas. 1.) it seems far too difficult to findthe golden (extremely rare weapons) and from what I understand they can only be found in Hard locked containers. So Id very much like for them to be found in both hard and very harder containers that'll increase the chances atleast slightly. Aswell if it is possible to make the .1% chance of finding a golden weapon compile able. By this I mean that if I were to open 1 hard chest and not receive a golden weapon that the next chest I open the odds become .2% and so on until I acquire 1 golden weapon after this the odds reset.      I know it's supposed to be hard to obtain them but so far I've had 2 play throughs without finding a single one. One play through in normal and the other in hard ( as well currently half way through a new game plus). With how difficult it is it's almost as if they don't exist in the game yet I only know they do from looking it up online.  2.) it seems that regardless of the size of a medkit I find in the game I only receive 1 kit for every 1 I pick up. If there are different sizes of kits it only seems resonable to have different amounts we pick up with them. Or maybe make the larger kits in game contain extra items like guaze alcohol string etc... Just seems a waste to me to have different sizes but all have the same amount to them.  3.) Playing as Zombie story mode. Other then having an objective to hunt down npc runners idk how this would be possible seeing as zombies are supposed to be mindless. The idea of it though sounds pretty awesome. Maybe one idea could be that your beginning to turn and the closer you are to turning the more hunter powers you get. After turning you must acquire antizen within X amount of time of you die. That's just one idea but would more or less be an extended game play and not really be playing as the zombie.Edited April 10, 2015 by Tims5962","Feature requests",1525

The ability to craft ammunition or increase storage for ammunition.4. The ability to craft a wing suit.5.

"2197","It would be awesome if the ""e"" key for kicking could be held down to charge up something like a round house kick. This would make the whole kicking ability feel less obsolete later in the game. Also, it would be nice to have the ability (after perhaps upgrading a later agility perk) to roll to the side or scramble backwards in the recovery time after a drop kick by clicking something like a, s, or d with the ""c"" key, allowing a player to momentarily avoid biters. These two changes would make unarmed combat feel a bit less clunky and a bit more more fluent. Also small changes like this ultimately could make unarmed combat feel less like a last resort, and more like an alternative to using weapons.Edited April 20, 2015 by Jack Mortem","Feature requests",1552

Crane has a pipe, no supplies in the background and he sits on the balcony with his legs over the edge.Level 5-9. Crane has a military shovel. some supplies and maybe an Airdrop in the background and he sits crouched looking over Harran.Level 10-14. Crane has a military machete with a mod. More supplies stockpiled and he is leaning against a pillar looking over Harran.Level 15-19. Crane now has a Khopesh with a mod. Lots of supplies in the background with saved survivors sitting together talking. Crane now sharpening his Khopesh next to the pillar.Level 20-25. Crane now has a Katana with a mod. Years of supplies in the background, saved survivors chatting. Crane now stands on the edge of the balcony looking over Harran like he is now. (Another minor thing is for Crane to have his equipped outfit in-game in the menu.)  Hope you liked my idea and agree.","Feature requests",1553

"2225","I won't be specifically expecting a change like this since I don't know how hard it will be to create it, but I would like to see two specific changes to the gameplay of Dying Light.1. Equipping players with the ability to run in slow motion for a short period of time while looking straight ahead. So many times I fall off towers and large buildings because I assumed I could jump across. With the ability to go slo-mo for a few seconds, players have more time to decide where to jump and land, making players even better free runners. This can be especially helpful while being chased by Volatiles at night in Old Town. 2. More detailed and realistic combat. This is what I want to see more than anything because the actual combat is one of my favorite parts in the game. And I mean realistic. For example, instead of hitting a zombie in the side with a baseball bat and taking a chunk out of its hip, the powerful swing breaks the zombie's hip leaving it either on the ground or limping towards you. Hitting zombies in the arms or shoulders with blunt objects should make their arms useless. Likewise, if I hit a human in the shoulder with a two-handed blunt object, the survivor will fall to the ground and can not fight due to the pain of a broken collar bone. I want to see more realistic physical affects like these more than I want to see new missions. ","Feature requests",1580

"2227","Id think it would be really cool to have unique bosses spread across the world. And they all have special attacks and patterns to learn. And all have different ways you have to kill them. And they would all have a chance to drop something special like a weapon or mod. And of course they would all respawn. That would really add to the end game and just variety to the overall game.

"2228","Hi! There are many good ideas in this post, too many to read them all! I'm Spanish, I apologize if someone does not understand the translation. (Google): D Okay, let's go for the ideas! First, I will talk about my experience with the game: - I have not finished the story, but I have all the skills!Someone should teach skills, not learning them at once, would not know how to explain this, but some will understand. - I put the game on hard mode:Now scary nightlife! but ... still I missing ""Zombies"" I do not want to attack me 4 once, I want to attack me 20 Zombies.(I need that experience). Increase Zombie magnetism, attending mass.  Now, show what you need, from my point of view. 1- The amount of zombies, you should go to eat, (increase please). 2- The zombies unique, for example, Goon, Firefighter, should have a texture jump list, so not all look the same. (Some variations, such as explosive barrels, there are green, white, red, minimum some variation) ""Variety is life"". 3- The shotgun, needs modifications, even cut the barrel, or explosive cartridges or shotgun slugs for opening a hole to a zombie. 4- Add more traps on stage, we have electric traps, such fire traps? (Not bad idea to Jeff, but much gas, equal to a big bang), perhaps a more controlled fire. 5- Money, sorry, but no sense in this situation, where you do not know if you'll live one more day, that way you have the money? need an urgent change, although I would opt for barter would not know how to adapt to the game. 6- Please, we need the tools in multiple languages. 7- The tools we need to import 3D models and textures, at least for weapons, and if you can, I do not know how.(Maybe a tutorial?). 8- Before I forget, there is very little blood, and the color  happens?Supposedly this is the apocalypse, when I throw a zombie one roof, only breaks her head and little blood!(This needs a big change), is a zombie game .  After that, I can only thank the team of Techland, who have engaged with the players, THANK YOU ALL. ","Feature requests",1583
"2229","I was hoping maybe in an awaiting update or DLC for there to be a open-world online PVP survival feature to the game. Not just Be The Zombie but where you can encounter other survivors(players) and either team up with them or kill them. Thank you.","Feature requests",1584
"2230","- Zombies can rock cars - make you loose balance and maybe fall off. - Rigged suspension bridge with accurate physics - something you can ground pound if there are zombies or thugs in your way  - As you get experience/stronger some bigger creatures can rip apart your safe zone(s) (when you're in it) - you will need to stop it rather than hide inside or just flee to the next one because if you let it, they will all be shredded! - MMO ( players may see each other as thugs unless they are on the same team)  -optional --->game chooses whether you are a thug or not based on if you randomly try to hit other survivors/players such as the ones in safe zones. - more storage for ammo and the ability to store ammo in the player's storage bag.. I have too much wealth but nothing much useful to spend it on. - Developers keep the Virtuix Omni Treadmill in Mind for compatibility.. also the ""HUD display"" with the Oculus Rift is too small and hidden almost off the screen! - Need some kind of wireless device support for sword/bat fighting like the PS Move to go with the Virtuix Omni Treadmill for more real world physical challenges/workout  but the device should also be able to be an accurate gun. - occasional rabid dog .. if you make noise in the day or night, it quickly looks at you, starts growling taking a step in your direction and if you make a sudden move or sound it starts running for you barking drawing attention from other Zombies. - not in their right mind, when zombies see you they should occasionally speak gibberish,  call you  $%$!@ turkey dinner get the #$@ back here!  -you're mobile food to them..some should be able to partially able to speak but not make sense. - it's freakier if zombies quickly look at you rather than if they are in a daze - at least have some that do this. - there should be at least one building full of zombie sleepers, maybe a hospital.. and as a quest you have to sneak across through rooms and either the floor squeaks or there is a squeaker toy that is set up to be more likely that it gets stepped on..  one room might have sticky stuff to walk on, the next bubble wrap stuck to your foot- you get the idea. - Marbles all over the floor - one area should have marbles and while you struggle to get one your feet and get out of there, the zombies (falling as well) within inches struggle to get you. as you fall the first time, a record skips to on mode and plays music something like  ""American Authors - Best Day Of My Life"" - something that just contradicts the atmosphere of the situation.. Benny Hill Theme music? -Thugs bind your hands and blindfold you and attempt to take you to their boss but on the way zombies compromise the room you're all in and the thugs freak out.. you see some bright lights (muzzle flash) through the blind fold - you mostly see black as you're moving through the area.. a zombie grabs your foot - one that dropped to the floor as it was being thrashed but now oddly it chewed through your leg ropes and now you're able to run  -hopefully in a direction you don't hear zombies . - Zombies and water - I actually had a dream before playing this game that I was travelling over houseboats and the docks and fell into the water only there were zombies standing on the bottom with their hands reaching up swaying with the tidal shifts, eyes open looking up. It would be interesting to have this and if you swim too close that some awake and grab you! - Vehicles - collect gas/alcohol in order to get it to run.. motor bikes would make a lot of sense to use for areas of tight spaces like traffic jams (skills needed to be able to drive up onto cars)  For those that disagree with vehicles in favour of Parkour  -Dying light is a fairly realistic game and it would make sense to have some vehicles.. people shouldn't be forced into one game play style but rather use and have fun with everything that is available to them. Vehicles could be made break down, get flat tires (might have to fix them) and explode when needed! Edited May 2, 2015 by Ascensi","Feature requests",1585

"2240","I believe I would speak for everyone when I say that new missions and more campaign will keep everyone playing this game. It doesn't even have to be a new map with new characters, and preferably not a new disc like Dying Light 2 but rather DLC, because the Slums and Old Town are perfect and a lot more can be explored in those places. There are so many paths Techland can go with a continuous campaign. I would love for Crane, our character, to go back to the Slums and help the tower out more. One of my favorite parts in this game was getting the feel of how desperate the people in the tower were. Keep coming up with more side quests that we can do to help the people of the tower out. As for campaign story missions, maybe the goal for Brecken now is to make the Slums a safer place. So he will send you on missions to help fortify the tower better and maybe even have missions where you clear out large areas FULL of zombies so more people can live in actual homes. Clear out the zombies and fortify the defenses to make more, larger safe zones in the Slums, with the eventual goal of eliminating zombies from the slums completely. I just want the campaign to continue. I loved the feeling of Crane getting personal with people in the tower like Brecken, Spike, Jade, and Rahim. I want more of those relationships. Maybe you do runner missions with Brecken himself. Also, the part of the campaign following the process of Dr. Camden creating a cure did not wrap up at the end of the game, so maybe more of those missions. I also think it would be really cool to have a campaign for the Be the Zombie mode. I'm thinking something like, you start out as a human during the outbreak who gets infected and turns. You play as a fast Infected zombie for a little bit until some radioactive incident creates the super zombie that you are in Be the Zombie mode. After that, you have campaign missions which require you to go out at night and hunt runners and destroy safe zones. Runners are experts, so you have to be creative in hunting them by using your own personal skills as well as the perks given from the skill tree. Speaking of skill trees, it would be nice to add more skills we can achieve while playing as Crane. Dying Light has the opportunity to be the best, most realistic zombie game of all time. And as long as there is new content and more story missions, I can guarantee I will continue to play for a very long time. ","Feature requests",1595

What I personally would like to see in this game is adding in some of the following as DLC or update either will suffice because I have the season pass. Here is some of my food for thought;craftable silencers is my biggest want/need for this game, along with the different types of craftable ammo such as, incendiary, explosive, tracer for the night etc. now you guys at techland creative studios may be sitting there saying yeah why, but i must ask how can you add such craftables as a freezing,electric,and impact shields as well as throwing stars but you cannot add in different types of ammo and silencers that would make the game alot more fun i mean i understand how it is melee based but everyone like guns in the game, also a bow and arrow/crossbow in there would also be quite awesome and a sniper rifle, that would just make the game so much fun because its versatile in all aspects. Some more rare weapons besides the korek machete and exp calibur, though i did not fully explore every crevice of the map i guess you guys could have added in more powerful developer tools that many have not discovered yet, ive always been a rare weapon guy like in dead island i had so much fun finding those rare skulls that gave you developer weapons that were wicked awesome. so please take some time and read through my article and maybe consider this you would have many many more fans then you already do of this game, it would just make the game more creative and more versatile like i mentioned earlier, also WE NEED MORE STORY MISSIONS OR A SUB STORY LINE this story line was fantastic in my opinion and i enjoyed it but please make us all happy thanks techland and add me on Xbox One ill be playing all night XxDanSensixX","Feature requests",1599

"2247","Things I think should be added to Dying Light. 1. People need something to work towards, increase the stat trees from 24-25 to 35 adding even more perks to get. 2. Weapons, Everyone likes stabbing and beating but why not add more guns? I few ideas are a good bolt action sniper a Rpg or grenade launcher of some kind and a light machine gun. Also if you wanted to ""camos"" that could be crafted, or purchased in a bundle for about $4.99. 3.  Also Small boats and helicopters. The reason being is let's face it the roads would be to hard to rework but the sky and water are open. Even possibly add ""Divers"" a new species of zombies that only live in water. 4. Lastly, people love killing zombies to keep them interested add more weapons and upgrades. Place new weapons in new places. Create a new small part of Harran. None of these things except #3 are to hard to code in.  ","Feature requests",1602

"2251","Antizim AirsupplyingWhen you end the game, you can insert antizim airsuplying to stop the infection. You can stock some antizim in you bag to save yourself or some NPC. If you don't give antizim each X days you randomly start to feel bad, slow and week (antizim story effect).  NPC Antizim suppliesWhen you save a survivor, you must take him to a safe room (where he/she remain). If you don't give them some antizim, they started to change in zombies and you must make safe again that place. To improve players to do this, you may put some benefits: for example you can find more object at the vendor, or the npc shoot the night hunter when he is near the safe room (but NPC never go out). Nomads safe roomsome time it's better to change place to live. After a radio message, you must protect X numeber of NPC to travel to another place (this place become a safe room ovviusly). If you play with friends or other players as survivors, one or two of them, can carry heavy bags or wounded NPC (when you do this you can't run, jump or fight) and the other player must defend the convoy. Bag Capacityi think that is better to reduce bag slot. Not for weapons, but for object like ""metal scrap"". The game lose is difficulty if you can carry 300 metal scraps, 300 medikits and other item of the same kind. Make your safe roomthe name explaine the idea, but you can make some quests to create a very functional safe room (to make it more easier, you could defend a place and bring a very huge numeber of resources to build it). Food?This is a survival game, i think is better to make a starving system. Light TorchWhe can find a lot of batteries during the game, but we never use these items to charge our Light Torch. I think that is very fun if this Object need to be charge with batteries. Weapons & DamageIn this game i have only strange weapons that deals 1000 or 2000 damage. Yes it is very funny, but i, personally, find it boring. Where are cook knives, water tube and the other 1000 intermediate weapons? Why i have only premium katanas or sacrifical sword? i think the difficulty mode must be change (zombies never have more life points, but increase their number or only their damages). And if possible, reduce damage melee weapons, becaouse these are too strong at high level.   Bikei love to ride on bike, if it possible ride and have a player on back of the bike to hit zombies with melee weapon.    If i seems arrogant, i'm very sorry but i'm too bad to write in english   These are some ideas, but the game remain always very fun! tnx for the attention    ","Feature requests",1606

As brilliant as the game is and as much as fun as it was to play in the beginning...I'm so sorry to say...I've just lost interest.   I was very excited to hear of the ""HARD MODE"" being introduced, and I do admit, it was most certainly a head in the right direction, but even with that minor tweak, the game is still just too darn EASY!  And my complaint from the very beginning has been primarily the lack of option to TURN OFF EVERY HUD ELEMENT THAT CONTINUES TO CLUTTER UP MY VIEW!!  I still wanna go out at night and try and survive getting around with nothing onscreen but the darkness surrounding me and what I can barely make out by daring to shine my flashlight around when I have no other choice.  That would really get me back into the game.  I just can't understand the necessity of the stupid HUD, ESPECIALLY that annoyingly useless ability level up progress bar!   Seriously...I've been completely leveled up for months now, but that thing still clutters up the view while serving NO PURPOSE whatsoever...and I never needed it in the first place.    And I'm playing on a 73 inch HDTV.    Come on guys...how hard can it be to give us the option to turn that stuff off?   Imagine how much more immersive and atmospheric the game could be.

In next gen there is very little reasons for almost everything in the game to be glued down.. what I mean is the environment don't get damaged at all.. not even cosmetic bash marks when you hit something with a really big hammer.. and a traffic cone should not block my path but get knocked around when I run though it.. other games can manage this kind of thing.. Im not expecting a battle field level of destruction of the map but differently more then this.. this game world as pretty as it is is more glued down and static then a COD multilayer map.. some of what Im asking about can be done with really good texture tricks so common man lol.. bot other things.. small items should fly when I hit them or run though them.. would like cars to get damaged when a can goes off next to them too.. but yeah.  I just really dont think I should be able to break my hammer on a tv or door and not see anything happen to that tv or door. It doesn't have to be perfect or even in this game.. but this is an idea I wouldn't take lightly as it adds to the immersion as other games have benefited from a less stiff world. this level of stiffness in this game sometimes makes you feel detached from it.Edited May 12, 2015 by joecow","Feature requests",1615
"2261","# 3. Im sorry but when you use a short knife it looks like your trying to use a paint bush and are painting them.. it doesn't help that there is not much impact or reaction from the zombie nor is there any visible wound inflected unless you manage to knock a limb off somehow which in its self is silly with a short knife... so the whole thing looks silly too me..  The stabs it dose sometimes dont enter the zombie at all so that looks silly..  This is also another attack that other games have done before so there is no reason this one cant.. when you do a stab the weapon should enter the zombie mode a bit and leave a mark and the silly paining should slash up the zombie a lot for it to look less silly. Basically being a experienced gamer and seeing all manner of methods on melee this one fails at times to make it seem as if my character is actually touching the foe with his attacks... it looks more like im coming within in a hair of touching them but still somehow damaging them.. this is surly outdated now as ways around this have been found by more then a few games.. Not every hit by every weapon is this way but there are a lot of these moments and the knife is the worst offender I seen so far. but yea that also goes for other weapons.. the head shouldn't automatically be obliterated but there should be different levels of it when using a blunt weapon... maybe the final hit will do it but not all a sudden with no warning after 3 hits that do no viable skull damage.. gotta try to really make the players first person model look like they are touching the other one.. some games do this by having the first person and 3rd person models one in the same. there are other ways though.and #4.  why cant I reclaim throwing stars.","Feature requests",1616

Build a mode where 30 Players or more if possible, join together in one map and survive and build their class along their survival journey.2. if someone die, his gear is lost and lootable by other players, so when you kill a player (YOU FEEL AWESOME) and death becomes more serious than just respawn.3. my HUGE WISH: i want to camp and JUST SIT with my buddies in online. do something like craft or cook or play mini games until the sunrise/sunset comes (FEEL HOME).4. i want to feel home and safe, and feel that this is my special spot if i find good one(like under the bridge in the old town), or find an empty apartment and just camp in it. all above i experienced in DayZ games, but as you guys know DayZ is chupacabra compared to you, you must know guys you are NOW THE BEST in zombie games..that's why i really really REALLY wish you would deliver these experiences in your AMAZING GAME.. i hope my cries reach you and you read my post. Regards.Edited May 14, 2015 by viokas_121","Feature requests",1623

Maybe this isnt fully possible as Zombies regenerate so you could make it so that if you kill a certain number of infected like a really large amount like 1000000 or as many as you think is in the cities. You could also make it so you have the challenge in each location so a reward to eradicate all zombies. Edited May 15, 2015 by christopherhi","Feature requests",1626

"2275","First of all, in spite of the fact that I detest and loathe zombies, I was drawn into playing this game out of curiosity.  I'd accidentally stumbled onto a walkthrough video on YouTube and was immediately interested in the graphics and apparent gameplay.  Turns out that it's been the hardest game (even on the 'normal' difficulty setting) that I've ever attempted to play!  During the first 10 minutes after the introduction I swear my Crane got killed on an average of once every 2 to 3 minutes; quite frustrating to say the least.  But, I persevered and when I got to the Extraction level, decided I could have done a lot more leveling up with my character and started all over again.  To my surprise, I've been enjoying the game tremendously!  Never played any of the Dead Island games, so for me there was no comparison to make, comparisons which didn't color my enjoyment of the game.  There are a few things that I would have liked to see changed, though. 1.)  WHY does the game give us the ability to obtain, upgrade, and improve all these fantastic weapons, yet when we're faced with a level-end boss-type situation, our character a.) has ALL, as in EVERYTHING taken away, so that we're left with no fantastic weapons or items like Molotovs, etc., and are forced to use a rusty blade in place of our Damage=995 trusty sword, b.) is rendered almost completely helpless, either due to the game forcing our character to be so worn out that he can't even use the grappling hook, or the game forces him into the seizures caused by the virus, wherein everything goes into a dreamlike state and it's damn near impossible to move the character in a straight line?  It's made me crazy that I've gone through all the trouble to upgrade my weapons, stash up on my arsenal of Molotovs, Exploding Trap Bombs, etc., only to have everything taken away from me when I have to face Rais' minions!  I call that CHEATING on the part of the developers!!!!!  It doesn't help that I've never been a fan of 'dreamlike' sequences wherein the character's abilities are diminished and he/she has to progress through an altered landscape that's disorienting, at best. 2.) One word: BINOCULARS!!!!!  It would have been great to have binoculars available to my character.  'Nuff said. 3.) Selective save points.  It makes me crazy that the game decides when to save for you; never been a fan of allowing the devs that kind of control. Otherwise, I really can't think of any additional areas that I feel need improvement.  I enjoy the fact that Dying Light turned out NOT to be just another FPS wherein you get all sorts of fancy guns with which to explode zombies' heads; if I want that I'll just go back and play one of the Stalker games.  I love that you have to depend on skills that you acquire and work for, so that weapon upgrading is almost secondary.  All in all, Dying Light is a great game and has already provided me with over 270 hours of enjoyment.  Now, if only I had a set of binoculars then I'd be happy.  Edited May 18, 2015 by DiaHorn","Feature requests",1630
"2276","I think Techland should take a look at Dying Light's longevity, and not in terms of what they're going to be doing with DLC. But with the game in-general. I think there could be a few improvements. Add some kind of penalty for lvl 25 survivors that manage to get themselves killed. What reason is there in trying to survive if we're no longer penalized for dying? Is there anything going to be done about this? I suggest we revert to Dead Island's severe money penalizing, as this would surely keep people on their toes and their eyes open. As someone who has capped the top survivor rank, it's clear to me that the game is now missing something. The incentive for not dying was to keep your survivor points so we could advance to the next level. Now the incentive for not dying should be to keep our cash, but unfortunately, dying no longer matters at a specific level. There should be more of an incentive to encourage people to undertake the challenge of night besides faster leveling for the three skill trees. Personally, I was thinking along the lines of slightly increasing the chance of orange drops in police vans. Possibly even gold drops, but that might just be an entirely different debate. This request is yet again in reference to level 25 survivors, but those who most likely spend that much time in your game are obviously some voices you should definitely consider listening to. At the current stage, for level 25 survivors, there's no point to play at night besides for the very dynamic shift in gameplay and difficulty. There is absolutely nothing to gain from night gameplay if your trees are capped out. There's no special events that occur (besides night air-drops), there aren't any blue merchants that appear, escort missions to participate in and why stay out at night for the challenge if I'm not going to be rewarded for my efforts? I like getting rewards, I don't want to just pat myself on the back.Please, just let us RESPEC and select skills freely without branching limitations once we cap out each skilltree. I like that we're never forced to choose one skill over another, but unfortunately some of the skills we're offered are either not believable or they make the game too easy. In my honest opinion, once you reach a certain level in agility or power, the player does not find much challenge when encountering enemies. To give an example, if I wanted to RESPEC my agility skilltree, to revert back from level 24 to level 1, with all of my points restocked, I would pay $10,000 - $20,000 to do this. Why would I want to do this? Well, I feel that the free-running expert skill makes the experience a little too easy for me. Crane climbs too fast and he has a supernatural level of stamina. I'm leaving Virals and Volatiles clueless when free-running. The thing is, I'd still want the Tic-Tac skill in my arsenal - but the only way to unlock that skill is to invest into the free-running expert skill. This would make me very happy and would render the game's difficulty consistent at a pace the player feels comfortable with.Give us more display personalization options. Taking away the cross-hair isn't cutting it. We want a ""No HUD"" option. We've asked for this countless times in many threads we've made and there still hasn't been a word discussed about it officially. Many of Dying Light's trailers are even presented without a HUD - this is something that we want. We also want to play this game without a HUD. We can manage, because we wouldn't ask to play without a heads-up display if we couldn't. The latest ""Bozak Horde"" trailer is also presented without a HUD. Yes, it's just a presentation but let's not resort to excuses!Edited May 19, 2015 by Wolfman","Feature requests",1631

"2278","I put here some ideas about multiplayer. mey be someone already posted it - didnt read all topic, sorry. 1)U should add Humans vs Humans mode(with possibility of assymetric match, for example: 1vs4, 2vs4; or non-assymetric: 4vs4, 2vs2, etc.) one team may be play as a Rais punks team, another team as a Brecken's tower team. During the match teams must take a supply cargos and deliver it to their base. Who will do it first - will win the match. add two variants of this mode: with firearms/grenades and without firearms(cold arms only).2)add posibility for players to play as volatiles in BTZ matches(on nighthunter side). add 1 button for survivors in online options - turn on/off volatiles invasion in their game. so, if survivor is not a sissy - he turned on this kind of invasion. if he is coward, then he can play only vs nighthunter without volatiles support. ps: i think multiplayer with this ideas will be much more fun. at the moment mp is a little boring for me(after ~300 ingame hours). and i am pretty sure u already thought about mods which i wrote here.Edited May 19, 2015 by boobafinno","Feature requests",1633

"2283","First off, this is a great game. First person is excellent, great job. I'm 41yrs old, started off playing Atari 2600, then 5200, then all the Segas, Playstations, xboxs, and build my own PCs. I really enjoy this game. I'm a veteran, so I thought I would add my desires to the list.Weapons-RPG, no brainer, it's middle east right? Trust me they are everywhere. Obviously a major zombie attractor. Make them rare or to refill your ammunition, you must go into a underground bunker that spawns various zombies of your choice. Weapons-Supressor (silencer)This attachment is crafted and has a limited lifespan. Materials are, metal parts X 5. Aerosol X 1. Duct tape X 5. Realistic and useful. Edit: also secondary wheel selectable.  Weapons-Rifle BayonetLoot item, craftable?, combat knife combined with the materials of your choice. Very realistic, lets let the firearm lovers have a playstyle for them. Limited lifespan? oh, I got an idea, bayonet is activated by choosing it on your secondary weapon wheel, that way you can stab or fire your weapon. Yes, that's it. Distraction device- Rocks. (Thank you far cry) Increased Stress-Water zombie, something in the water? You gotta do it, maybe a zombie that has learned to consume underwater plants, a stressor and competition for items.  Grappling hook-Okay, I like ""just cause"" but the grappling hook in this game, with your apparent love for realism just doesn't feel right. I think you need a more ""far cry 4"" feel. Trust me, physics trump magic. Well, I'll think on it some more, til next time. Thank you.Edited May 25, 2015 by Badassack","Feature requests",1638

"2285","How about speeding up the load times on this game, takes awhile just to load the game up, not to metion loading times going to other areas, nice game, but slow loading, rather play a game that loads quicker, too much wait time between loads","Feature requests",1640
"2286","Things I'd die for if there was a multiplayer mode like this in the game, or any game (hint- hint) *Hardcore mode. Eating, drinking, fatigue. If you don't eat and drink your health will be reduced, or even make you vulnerable for easy knockdowns etc. Also make your stamina etc drain faster. (millions of fun options that can be explored) There is already fatigue in the game. And not unlike the Dark Souls series your gain stamina in Dying Light at a slower rate when you enter that state. Keeping you from attacking, blocking, dodging, or running. Making you really vulnerable. (I Love this feature, and thanks Techlab) Give players an exhaustion debuff as a penalty if you don't pay attention to your stamina and drain it continuously.. if you keep spamming your buttons continuously, or run too long, draining your stamina completely, you will get exhausted, and to get out of the fatigued state, you'd either have to sleep, or wait for a while, use consumables etc.  Permanent Deathor death penalties. Fill Harran with some serious anxious survivers. Add additional stats in the form of some kind of journal, where you can track which day it is, and how long you've survived in Harran's zombie hell. You have to learn every aspect of the game, it would require every player to pay attention to every feature of the game to survive and build a powerful character. I can only imagine meeting someone in the game and going on a quest to acquire some kind of awesome weapon from a hellhole without dying once, the teamwork we'd have to put into the game to pull it off etc. How exciting it would be, and how immensely satisfying it feels when you have it. Quests?Side quests can't be too much of a problem to make. Not for a survival game at least.And how awesome wouldn't it be if we could have quests that intervene with the main story. Meet some runners from the tower out in the field where they've been injured and need some medicine that you have to run and get them. With a permanent death, or other penalties. Imagine how that would play out! ""chupacabra. I'm low on health, should go back to the tower, but kurczak it. I could need whatever he offers me for the job. I mean, I'm saving his life goddamnit."" You could die though during the mission, loosing everything you've earned.""   I would appreciate if Techland made a multiplayer mode that you can select after you've finished the story. Not unlike GTA online.. With custom characters, doesn't have to be too fancy. The outfits in the main game are good enough, and doesn't seem too difficult to add more of. So female characters? Different characters? I understand you need the story character to be who he is, but the multiplayer is weak imo. It feels unfinished  And the fact that Techland talked about having more characters in the game earlier, makes me think they chose an easy way out of a bit more work. Last note: Voice acting seem to be a big issue in games, and people state that it's expensive and take a lot of time etc. But hmm, I can't understand how choosing someone who can read with a bit of passion is such a big problem? There's no lipsync on our character, and the story isn't too deep on the personal levels. It's not like a woman couldn't have been in Kyle's shoes. He's not like a male specific person with a male specific story. Doesn't make any sense to me.  Thats all I had to say. Sorry if it makes no sense to you! Also, most of these things has been mentioned a lot throughout this thread, so I'm not stating totally new ideas here.

"2290","Thanks Techland for making the best zombie game yet!  the movement and story is incredible.  My friends and I would love some additions others have already touched on.    How about this:  add a place in each map (like a ""mall"" or walmart store) that you can scavenge from for items you must have (water, bandages, health packs, food, building supplies, cement bags, welding supplies, weapons... etc).  The supplies to survive and build the fortresses to defend at night (another post about this).   The ""mall"" would be surrounded by zombies both inside and out. The team would have to find a way in (killing zombies of course), scavenge till full or found the items needed, then get out with the supplies.  Board up the ""new safe house"", and survive zombie hordes.   rinse/repeat... harder levels as you go on... see how many levels you can live thru.... or just keep going till your tired.  maybe have the team pick how advanced each level gets as you move on.  Say something like 10% harder each time  or 50% harder each time.  you could do leader boards by difficulty level picked. Please add more to the co-op adventure!  please please please!Edited May 26, 2015 by theBringer","Feature requests",1645

"2297","Ok so I was having a ton of CTD's durign ver. 1.5.1 but now in 1.6 game work flawlessly. You guys are putting so much effort. Now what I would recomend is: -Rebalance the parkour challenges. They appear even when you are playing the prologue and while trying to do one of them I realized that they are unbalanced (even more if our score are going to the leader board) because at agility level 1 is pretty much immposible to win even the medium difficulty ones. Either rebalance them or make them appear latter in the game. -add a kaybinding to be able to check your watch. -add more variety of sruvivors outside safezones and during random encounters, why aren't there any women outside, like the only female is Jade? -add a way to use your fist in a simple way, is so tedious having to unassign a wapon from your four weapon slots then having to go to control setting and assign a key to that empty slot, because when you use the mouse wheel it just skips the empty slot and continuest to cicle only between weapons. -also for the fist we could use brass knuckles. -add some way to hide during the night outside a safe house, something like when it gets dark some containers and wardrobes now can be used as a hiding spot so that way we can lose pursuit from the Volatiles... -Talking about the Volatiles... it always has bothered me that during the day zombies are standing like poles wherever they are, make them move around like Volatiles do. -Please give us more access to content in the dev tools there is like 20% of the assets available. -Finally. Please, please!!! let us skip the intro some how, in between the constant patching (during ver. 1.5 the game wouldn't recognize my save file until I updated to 1.5.1, but it happen again with 1.6, but I rather start from zero than to have constant CTD's) and mods I had to restar my game from zero about 5 times already and to be able to play online... you know, the Prologue...Edited May 29, 2015 by Gordon Beardman","Feature requests",1652

This request and idea will hopefully come to light to address the issues that has plagued the content thus far and will hopefully be carried out to ensure that all can enjoy regardless of player level. Known issuesDemolisher sometimes immune to attacks; even propane tank explosions!!!!!Bomb still goes off EVEN WHEN TRIAL IS CLEARED OR IT JUST SIMPLY GOES OFF ON IT'S OWN WITHOUT REASON!!!!!!!Demolisher HP too highNo checkpoints3-chance allowanceReward requirements for arrows too strictTrial time limits TOO SHORTRequestFix bugs where propane tanks do not do damage on Demolishers.Fix bugs where bomb explodes suddenly; killing player.Demolisher HP reduce by 50%. Checkpoints added so that a choice can be given to player to start where he left off instead of the beginning.Remove 3-chance allowance (Campaign Bozak challenge allows multiple tries why not this!?).Remove requirements for special arrows; now we only need to just clear Bozak Horde (the content is already too hard)!Option to remove Trial Time LimitIdeasAllow players who cleared Bozak Horde before to bring their own gear and weapons (Harpoon etc.).Add new weapon: CHAINSAW.Add new national outfit: SINGAPORE (to celebration the nation's 50 years of independence)Add new skill: HARPOON STRIKE (Harpoon shoots out, pulls enemy and delivers forearm ramming attack).Additional cutscene where the player kills Bozak violently.I hope for a reasonable reply from Techland.

"2307","Hi - I love the game.  I cannot express that enough. I have a handful of suggestions that might help: 1.  Outfit customization like Destiny so characters can really personalize their look - this is great for expressing personality in the game and good for after you have already beat the game - it still gives you another thing to work on.  (Also cosplayers would probably love it) 2. An occasional zombie (or ex-survivor that just turned) with an obvious backpack or large bag on his back that would carry more than the usual amount of loot.  Kind of like a walking treasure mine.  You can put one in each city area so you have to work to find one.  But the treasure has to be good  3. A higher lever for weapons so you can keep building your perfect weapons with greater damage since you will ultimately have to ditch each weapon after it breaks 4. An air vehicle like a mini-copter - since a land vehicle would mean re-writing the games layout.   But there should be a mission in order to get it unlocked.  And you should have to grab pieces like a lawn mower engine from one place and a frame from a body shop or hobby shop.  Or its just covered in a garage somewhere and you have to get gas and a new engine or something.  It would be great to see the landscapes from above.  I know you guys dont want to do the gun thing that much but a sniper rifle or anti-aircraft gun would be awesome to use.  Since its a single shot, they'll have a harder time over using them in crowds of zombies. (not like a machine gun) Hope this helps ","Feature requests",1662

"2311","I'd like to see additions to skill levels. There could be more abilities added beyond level 24 or 25.. there's no compelling reason to survive the dark for double agility and survivor points since most players are already maxed Add more adventure. Even after latest update, i really dont find it necessary to keep returning to the same quarantine areas to find something different. Add more of the quirky missions you stumble upon where you need to help survivors travel the map, make these become harder as the player defeat them and more interesting, different perceptive of the outbreak in Haram. Consider adding different types of these stranded missions unique to day and night. You dont really need more voice actors, subtitles on the screen works just fine.

"2312","I think the player should be allowed to make their own choices as to how the want to play the game, as opposed to linear gameplay. Like, the Gazi mission where you have to go get chocolate and a tape for him. I want the option to be able to just kill him, and have repercussions from another group. Let say you go to the tower, and kill someone from the tower. Rais likes you more, the Tower likes you less. Something like a Good/Evil system like in Infamous. Options are good. ","Feature requests",1667

"2314","The ability to save when the player wants to save the game IE: in a safe zone, and you know that when you play the game again that you will be where you want to be and not where the game will put you. For example I just delivered antizin to Jade on floor 19 of the tower, after some dialogue I quit the game, the I thought I will see where it put me, it put me on a road some way from the tower, not on floor 19 of the tower.","Feature requests",1669
"2315","Here's an idea:  Why don't you acknowledge your goddamn forums?","Feature requests",1670
"2316","I think it would be fun to add on another hardcore game mode, exactly like hard mode but with a twist. In this game mode players replay variants of Main story quests or Side quests and face enemies that are harder to kill, in greater number, and can kill the player more easily. If the player survives, reward them with powerful weapons or upgrades for their weapons, skins, outfits and a ton of in game cash. If they die, they get jack. Alternatively, it would be awesome as a standalone game mode where the player starts form the beginning and has to complete the entire game. They get their special rewards as they complete major quests. If a player dies, their progress during a mission is lost, and they must start the mission over. If they beat the entire game on this game mode maybe they unlock some ridiculous prize...A helicopter with dual machine guns that they can fly around Harran with their four buddies tearing up Zombie Hordes.  I think another fun game mode would be to hold out against unrelenting hordes of Zombies for as long as possible. My buddies and I loved to get to the last chapter of the stories in Left 4 Dead and instead of getting on the escape vehicle, we'd try to hold off as long as we could as waves of Zombies, tanks and special infected closed in on our position. It would be a blast for four players to arm themselves to the teeth and hold out against waves of infected, volatiles, viral, Goons, Demolishers, just anything you can throw at us. Cheers!","Feature requests",1671
"2317","I think the most important thing to look at when thinking of ideas to give a game longevity is to first look at what kind of game it is and how its set up. If its online and has a progression system in place as those like Destiny, WoW, etc, then you can do certain things with that. Dying Light is set up as such that you can't go the same route to try to give this game longevity. Once you beat this game, there hasnt been much reason to keep playing other than just trying to get a Gold weapon for chupacabra and giggles (which by the way is ridiculous. I have beaten the game on Hard, and now played ad additional 40 or so hours and have yet to see a single Gold weapon. Zero, Zilch, Nada).     With Dying Light, you guys have the perfect opportunity to make a new age ""Survivor"" HORDE mode. Once where you have several areas of the city that you can instance into a version of that area and have endless wave Horde modes. You guys have to understand that if you want to keep a game like THIS one going, survivor ""zombie"" horde mode is the way to go. It gives TONS of replayability, as people have a blast just trying to beat their old records or make leaderboards for going the most rounds, from solo boards to up to 4 player boards. With this game, you could even keep the open world game relevant, as you can set it up where you have to play the open world and do its activities to get the weapons you will need for the Instanced endless Survivor games. Definitely wouldnt want it to take tons of time so you'd have to ease up on the Gold weapons a bit and make those and orange drop more often. Heck, you could even have things you can work towards in the open world game that would benefit you in the Survivor mode games and help you possibly get further. There is SO much ideas you could do for a game like that. Get it done Techland! You guys have been awesome but there just is zero reason to keep playing this game. There is nothing relevant to do, and the only thing I try to do since there are no other good games out atm for me, is get Gold weapons., of which I still havent came across a single one in probably 100+ hours of gameplay.","Feature requests",1672
"2318","In BTZ, it would NORMAL health kits that works the same way as in hard mode. That is to say, not an instant healing but progressive. It's absolutely revolting to see survivors who heals in combat while retreating. The only way to kill humans  who really knows how to play (DODGE / UV) is the melee attacks. But because of the health kits, it is impossible. They fear nothing: they evade (spam) everything the dodge is broken. Instantly heals all the time, The grapple can be used 4 times before being unusable (which never happens, as it recharges when you stop using it) allows excessive aggression on the NH and the Mobility become completely broken (Horde spit useless). Could you adjust the problems of balancing which favoures humans ? Ps: Of course, I am writing this message in the hope an answer that probably never happen. You will continue to ignore the issues cited in the section BTZ much longer? The only place I saw a dev reply, it is in ""developers tools"" Let us know you are there, you are aware of all this.

"2319","This is just my list of idea's I came up that I thought could be added to the game. When the game has more than 1 player  I think the hunter's stamina should have some sort of resistance scaling to the amount of people that are in the server, because there's nothing more annoying than a hunter just zipping through and then to like instantly fall out of the sky because he has 4 laser tracking him.Allow the hunter to crouch so he won't show up on the human players radar. Its bad enough every time he uses the echo location he lights up like a christmas tree.The game severely lags for the hunter after at least 9 flares end up on the floor.For the love of god can you do some thing about humans aborting their games, I played a game where literally the guy was on his last life and I got him into the pounce animation and he then he just immediately left the game. I didn't get the bonus 2000 experience points for winning the game.The hunter should have some sort of war cry and help cry that just summons a bunch of zombies around him when he needs it. I would limit this power to a one time use every life so there wouldn't be any way to over use the power. ","Feature requests",1674
"2320","I have some good balanced ideas for some new abilities In Dying Light for each skill-tree. AGILITY: Crowd Run- This skill follows the vault stun ability and works when vaulting over a large horde of infected. When vaulting into a horde you can continuously run along their heads. The maximum amount of zombies you can run along is a max of 4. POWER: Lancer- This skill follows the Ram ability and works when Ramming into an infected while charging your attack button. When Lancing, you run into an infected and instantly kill it while running. It requires an edged light, medium weapon, (dagger, machete, sword.)SURVIVOR: Spike traps- This skill follows the Car trap ability and can help you set up your own spike traps around Harran. When you get the ability, you can craft one out of 8 metal parts, 2 Duct tape, 3 blades and a wooden board (found lying in skips and on the ground.) Once crafted one can place them in any desirable location around Harran.  Hope you enjoyed my skill ideas and reply to me if you have any suggestions. ","Feature requests",1675

"2328","1. I would love to see like a horde attack on the safezones. For example every once in a while a safezone gets surrounded/attacked by zombies, and you have to get them away (firecrackers, loud noises etc.) or kill them in order to not make them break in. 2. It would also be nice if you still had to get antizin from airdrops (because you are infected and still need it) and that airdrops started to come again after you save the town from being bombed by the ministry. 3. Modify some terrain (chopping wood, making pits etc, but not huge differences) 4. When you are ""Freerunning expert"" or get the skill where you can climb and sprint forever without getting tired, I think climbing obstacles is a little to fast. 5. Making your own weapon modifications would be incredible! Repairing weapons should also be worked a little more on IMO. Because just taping your weapon together after it almost breaking into 2 pieces is just wierd. Maybe using a sander? (if that is what it is called) to make a weapon sharp again or sharper? 6. Also, if possible, could there be like a randon quest generator? Which randomly generates quests to do in game. Does not have to be advanced quests. For example (cardboard letters saying for example: Hello runner! If you read this then I hope you can help us! We are running low on x(amount of food/water/metal parts etc.) If you can get this for us we would be amazingly grateful! Reward is x(amount of money) and x(amount of XP) 7. Make us able to fish! 8. More place to explore (bigger map) :3 9. Climbing cross directioned? (not just up, down, left or right, make us able to go the arrow directions on the letter x too) 10. Make an actual animation movement for climbing down please. And a wallrunning (skill?) where you run on the  walls and kill a zombie as shown in this video at 0:32 https://youtu.be/KalIE_Otylo 11. Why cant we see Brecken again? And why is Spike both in Sector 0 and in Slums as a quartermaster? 12. It would be nice to have a another kind of grappling hook! a one that is more ""swingy"" 13. And finally, for the last suggestion for now, it would be cool with a (DLC?) where you get to play as Amir, before Kyle Crane got to Harran and do what his mission was (he was a another GRE agent) EDIT: (the bold text is the new suggestions) 14. Make us able to explore and/or secure the rest of the tower(s?) 15. In the quote below it is mostly about weapon damage. I totaly agree with that when finishing the game and getting in max level, you have overpowered weapons. But my point is, from most zombie movies and such, it is way more stealth than it is here, so if it was a bit more stealth (options?) in the game it would be perfect. also what Sora, on 19 Jun 2015 - 07:06 AM, said:I know this request is old but please up zombie health or lower weapon damage, at the beginnig of the game two or more zombies made you kinda worry but now 20 of them is now a push over i miss the fear of the horde, i really dont touch the game any more because of this its just boring that there is no more fight in the horde, dont get me wrong the runners, the goons, and all the other specials are fine but the walkers need to change using a weaker weapon doesnt help either so maybe readjusting weapon dmg might help, make the rarity of the weapon matter all the weapons do one hit kill dmg (and doent give the ""My weapon does over 2000 dmg"" thing) because lets be honest that really doesnt make a difference when a green bat one shots just like an orange one, i think every thing under orange should take 3-4 hits and more going down the rarity list and so orange and gold become that more worth it to find, gold should be tht one hit kill dmg thats ok but every thing else no so please techland maybe look into this? fixedside request:If it could be done maybe have the demolishers appear randomly around the map outside of their spawn zones and if you can make that guy that repairs your weapon a quest and that he now stays in the tower and and the safe hub in old town so player have to pay to have thier favorite weapon Edited June 26, 2015 by Crausean","Feature requests",1683

There would be PvP but it would be optional and maybe a player increase to 8 players so there would be more to PvP  3.There could be more dynamic gameplay like making your own safe house because there would be no safe houses so making it players will have to their own safe houses for example you would close off windows get bulbs for the UV lights which should have a duration of how long they last and zombies should attack your safe house especially if there is no UV 4. There would be NPC bases but they would be nutreal to you and their outpost gets attacked 5.Collectible resources to build your safe house like collecting wood to build fortifications and being able to move furniture to cover doors and windows but zombies can eventually push them or break them down For now that's all I have to say about my idea","Feature requests",1689

"2340","Please balance out Rais' Arena in the storyline on Hard difficulty. Actually fighting a super-demolisher with a damage 67 hammer and waves of virals without medkits and no repairs is just a bit sheisterish, especially since every death regenerates some of the demolisher's HP, but doesn't respawn any of the weapons or explosives. While the difficulty is sit to hard, that section of the game was challenging enough on Normal, and allowing players to bring in their medkits would be relatively balanced on Hard Mode, given the fact that it takes time to regenerate HP. Respawning assets upon death, scaling up the arean weapon damage values a bit, and having the demolisher running into spikes break off armor would go lengths to help out players. Honestly speaking, combining all of the aforementioned fixes could potentially take the challenge out of that story mission, but by employing a few, it could still be challenging, but also fair to players, and make it seem more like a game, and less like we've been thrown into an arena to die by a psychopathic maniac. 11/10 for Authenticity though.","Feature requests",1695

It's incredibly boring as it feels and controls exactly like every other two handed weapon in the game. When introducing gold tier weapons they made uniquely named weapons like the fantasy weapons, the Gonunaba, the Loco, etc. So why not go a step further and add unique moves and attacks to these weapons? Kinda like how Dark Souls does it. The two handed weapons in those games all control in their own unique and refreshing way.

"2344","I've seen a number of posts about Dying Light not featuring a thirst/hunger survival system. I would like to see am ultimate survivor mode where a thirst/hunger survival system could be integrated maybe a whole separate difficulty so that it could be an option and not something incorporated into the whole game. And I don't know whether or not it would be possible to accomplish but in said ultimate survival mode could have a larger amount of virals after several series of explosions and there could be bitten survivors who turn viral on the streets as a survivor incident and survival of running from or fending off the viral or group of virals would lead to the accumulation of survival points. I know your team at techland is set on creating a very different and brilliant zombie game.

Plus its been done by other games. What I would like to see is ""Safehouse Assaults"". Periodically safe zones would come under attack by a huge zombie horde. The player could choose to either directly intervene and repel the assault or not. These would take place during the day primarily, But at night perhaps a safe zone could run out of power and loose the UV lamp defense. Since there are gasoline canisters lying around it would be on the player to retrieve the canisters and take them to the de-powered safe zone while it is being attacked by the horde. The more players in a game would affect the size and strength of the horde. If a player chooses to ignore the assault then the safehouse would be reset to red and the player could ""resecure"" it at a later time. The safehouse assaults could also be done by human npcs, either rais's men or other survivors who are not part of brecken's crew. The penalty for not pushing back the human npc assault would be that quartermasters have less items for a certain period of time or shop vendors have severely reduced inventory for a set period of time until the safehouse is secured again. Successfully repelling an assault could give the player a weapon docket or 1 free weapon repair similar to how the blue shield protect missions operate. I have to say I love dying light and think it is great how Techland continues to support and evolve this amazing game.  ","Feature requests",1701

"2356","It would be nice to have abit more organization when buying/selling weapons. Specifically when looking for the type of weapon you want to buy.Example: Want a hammer or wrench, look in the short blunt weapons column. Got yourself a nice stack of cash, look in the long sharp weapons column and treat yourself with a samurai sword. Even if you don't have ALOT of money, but you still want that type of weapon, you can get a machete instead. Because I feel that weapon availibility in shops should depend on who your buying from and how expensive it is, rather than a randomly generated (short) list of weapons based on your level. The only times I have ever seen samurai swords or guns in the shop is when I already found those weapons. Than my sword finally breaks completely, I go back to the shop/s, and no one has a sword. That happened to me three times. The weapon availibilty seems so random, that it feels smarter too just use the shop to sell old weapons to buy Items (crafting tools and ammo). It would also be cool if you could specialize in different weapon types (a melee and a distance weapon) that unlock special perks and moves. In this way, players can strategize according to each teammates' strength or just help people coordinate better.Example: someone who's specialized with knives might receive improved durability, more repairs, higher damage, better handling, and even weapon specific quick finishes/takedowns that you can earn through kills or learn some technique where you can stun kill a few zombies with your blade in rapid succession. But since he's also specialized in throwing stars as his distance weapon, the player could have increased range, precision, damage, elemental effect, rate of fire, and a higher number of multi-throw targets, which would make him a valuable asset at any range. Because even though you'll have different strengths, you should be able to use variety, and never feel one-dimensional. It would also be cool if you could build, customize, and upgrade your own safe zone(s). you could build defenses, traps, even build a community that protects it because you've made it their home. It can be an HQ, where your in charge. It could also be used for multiplayer: call a friend to help you defend it against hordes of zombies,a rival faction, or fanatical groups that have sprung up in the chaos. Because in any type of apocalyptic scenario, you know there will be people who'll take advantage of the insanity and use it to manipulate other people. Or there can be a game mode where a player is trying to attack another player's base as a faction leader or as a super-zombie with a horde at his back. Making the other players need to work together to defend the base and watch out for the invading player. you can even make two groups of players against each other while 1 or 2 other players attack both groups as zombies. You should have to clear rival factions and bad/insane people from safe zones as well as zombies. Safe zones could be more occupied after clearing them with more important characters that can help you if your close by and in a tight spot. Maybe even call for them to help you complete a mission. That would create so many more options, and make you feel like you got some backup both with or without multiplayer. Multiplayer would be better, of course, as a player would be more effective, but it would be nice to have some kind of back up without always having to be online for it. Ideas:1. strike/throw/shoot while hanging(that could be 2 or 3 upgrades)2. climb down, survivor sense can now detect more threats(he should be able to hear threats other than volitals, especially if he can sense supplies that are out of sight)3. knockdown kick (hold the kick button to make him do a spinning back, side, or front kick that can knock the enemy into other enemies and adds some extra style).4.Crafting gun equipment :a temporary silencer, scope, dual-mags for faster reloading, elemental shot gun shells, more melee options with fire arm equipped, more types of firearms, double barrel shotgun, hunting rifle, revolver (none would have as many shots or as fast a rate of fire as what is in the game, but they would all be more powerful, the last 2 have more range, and sawed-off could be optional, giving players more control over how they want to arm themselves. Guns should still be hard to come by, just with more alternatives. I like the combat in this game a lot, but I can't help but notice that Rais' men can block your attacks and many times even block incoming projectiles. It would be nice to be able do/learn that. There could also be a more extensive countering system, where you can combine that judo redirect(grapple) with strike to perform a counter-strike that weakens enemies and can be upgraded to stun. Then, after the enemy has been thoroughly weakened, you can perform a special kill-counter the next-time he comes at you. Then you could start to add more elite enemy types that can counter your strikes, and get an upgrade later where you can counter their counters. That would create a very cool combat environment that hasn't been explored enough in first-person-perspective games, and with the way the current gameplay is, it already has the perfect foundation to push the envelope. SPOILER!!And a lot of games have been missing boss battles lately, but it would be nice to have one at the end where you need to use different combinations of the skills and items you've learned  and earned throughout the game. I'd also like the story to be deeper and have choices that effect plot points, your relationships with characters, and the strength of factions and/or groups. Thank you guys so much. This game is already incredible, and I hope just helped the sequel (or any upcoming DLC) be even more incredible. Can't wait for the next one.Edited July 16, 2015 by JunBug","Feature requests",1711

Unless both players are extremely limited in terms of the distance that they can be separated, this can't happen because of the console's limitations. The number of enemies that can be rendered on screen would be dramatically decreased, and overall, this is a game designed for the solo/online experience. In addition, Dying Light focuses heavily on movement. Being able to quickly put distance between you and your enemies using any means necessary. How would night pursuits work when your partner is scrounging through an apartment and you find yourself cornered by Volatiles, but you can't escape because your partner isn't with you?  The reason why games like Left For Dead, Advanced Warfare, or, let me give you another example: Minecraft - are able to be played in split-screen, are because they're linear and/or run with spare resources to support split-screen co-op. Dying Light being as beautiful and invigorated as it is - comes with a price. And that's split-screen co-op. A split-screen Dying Light would either have to be visually downgraded or a linear experience like the Bozak Horde.  But hey, I think Dead Island 2 might have split-screen co-op, so you have that.","Feature requests",1714

"2361","I didn't check 83 pages for this: side missions that are only playable online.  The campaign progresses as usual, but in order to complete a side mission the player would have to be open to outside players coming in being either good guys or bad guys.  Like some of the side missions were you help a NPC with his mission, the NPC would actually be played by another player.   Same with bad guys.  Players could be Rais' men or civilians trying to kill Crane for the Antizine.  Could have players be Rais' men during, say, the Museum mission trying to save Jade. While it's too late to implement in the current game for most of these, the new side missions could be implemented similar to the Bozak mission.  Playable-NPCs could be opened to only those who have reached a certain level in the game to ensure relatively strong players.  Campaign missions would probably have to wait until Dying Light 2. A bonus to this would be the ease of which to balance the power of the goods guys versus the bad guys--who aren't zombie monsters.   *Just seconds after posting I was reminded of the movie The Matrix; players being able to take over any bad guy character.  It could be any shambling zombie which would have limited abilities, any of Rais' men, bombers, HazMat guy, volatile, whatever.  It would certainly add a bit on unpredictability to game play.  We generally learn the game AI of all of the characters and that makes things a bit easier.  Add a human-controlled character and then it's not as trivial to handle.  Oh, and no warning whatsoever the bad guy is human controlled!Edited July 20, 2015 by SomeOldDude","Feature requests",1716

"2363","They tried PVP for Humans on The Bozak Horde. It didn't work well at all, most of the attacks didn't even register!However I don't know about the CO OP one though I don't think it will work out that well, considering the fact he has to go to a certain location and how he could just go off path.Not only that, but he could farm Rais's Men and Hostile Survivors.","Feature requests",1718
"2364","I hope the developers read this! I just finished Dying Light and I had a real blast with it, all in all it was an amazing game and I don't think killing zombies has ever been so satisfying. Now I could list all the good things about it, and I will take up some points, but there are also some things that I hope can be improved for the sequel or your other games.  My first point is that I played the game on hard mode and I think I would not have liked the game nearly as much if I had been playing on normal. My point with this is that I really hope that you will include a hard mode that is more about survival in your next game also. I heard that hard mode was added in later, and while this is nice I would actually be hesitant to buy your games on release day if I know the mode I would rather play would be inserted later. I hope this will not happen in the next game but that we get hard mode from the beginning.  Another point is that I used a mod that removed most of the HUD. I really don't understand why developers clutter their game with so many HUD elements, it is so annoying and takes away so much from the experience. I would not have liked the game as much if I did not use a mod to remove the HUD, but the fact that I need to mod the game to be able to do that is bad, and it should be something you could have as an option (Now you need to have some more options then just ""on"" or ""off"" since some HUD elements you may want, like the healthbar etc. But the best option would be to be able to remove or add exactly what you want (look at your other polish developer and Witcher 3 for a good example of being able to turn on or off pretty much every single HUD element) Again this is another thing that hold some users back from buying the game at launch, like me, if I know the developer won't let me customize the HUD with the vanilla game I rather wait and buy the game later when I know there are mods out for it. So please consider this. Especially if you go for immersion as less HUD always gives much more immersion.  I loved how you went for the real-time inventory and map setting, always making you stay on edge, that makes me think you value immersion very much and I really think you did something wonderful there. More immersion is never bad! Now for some more specific gameplay issues. Again, the gameplay in Dead Light was incredible smooth and satisfying, the combat and feeling of hitting zombies the best I have experienced I think. There was a couple of problems though, mainly with the fast zombies (the ones that come running if you make a loud sound). While the idea of having more dangerous zombies that will be attracted by high sounds are great, since it makes you think more strategic about what weapons or tactics to use. However I feelt the execution of these enemies to be the games biggest flaw. While most of the game and its world feelt very dynamic and ""real"" and grounded, the fast zombies feelt very artificial and ""gamey"". Basically you understood very quickly that as soon as you make a high sound these enemies are just spawned from thin air near you. It also does not help that they seem to have some kind of radar sense and instead of being actually attracted to the sound they instead just home in on the player like they always know where you are. It feels just very frustrating and ""unrealistic"" if you can use that word in this setting. It would be much more interesting if these runners actually existed in the world and they COULD come running if you made a loud sound, especially if you then did not quickly moved away. It could be fun to lay a trap or an explosive and quickly climb to cover and have them run to the sound and then look for you. As it is now when they just home in on you they just become extremely annoying and take you out of the experience. There is very much potential here, but I feelt this was the biggest flaw with the game. Another thing that also needs to be reworked for the sequel is the lockpick minigame. They also become extremely tedious very very fast. Firstly the actual mechanic of the minigame does not feel all that tight, while it is almost an exact copy of that in Skyrim it does not feel as responsive. And second is that it is used waaay to often. In Skyrim you come across a locked chest from time to time, but it is usually not to frequent. Here in Dying Light, especially in some of the indoor locations like the quarantine zones you often stumble across a locked door, forcing you to do the minigame, and then once it opens there are 2-3 more chests inside for you to do the minigame on. It just becomes old very fast. If the fast zombie attracted to noise worked better I think an alternative would be to have the option to bash locks open but risk making loud sounds, that way you would not be forced to do the minigame over and over again if you don't want to. I fast started to ignore the red chests in the game altogether since I just could not stand another lock minigame, it did not help that the loot in these chest where of variable quality. If you will have locks and minigames on chest, save them for the really valuable and rare chests I think. Another thing that is a bit related to the minigame is that there needs to be a way to quickly abort an action. While I love the fact that you can see your own body in the game and that you actually see the character do things in the game, like bending down to open a chest and not just have it magically open without touching it, it is some gap between that mechanic, the real-time action and zombies attacking you. I found that if you want to abort an action it can take several seconds sometimes, time that you don't have if a zombie is eating your neck. I really love all the real-time focus you have in the game, never pausing even in inventory menu, that is awesome! But you should be able to instantly get out of whatever you are doing (like picking a lock) if a zombie is near and attacking you! My last complaing is while most of the sidequest where fun, I found the more ""filler content"" like the zombie killing missions and the parkour mission to feel very much like.. filler. They where not that fun and they actually took away from the feeling of Harran being a real place with a real serious story. These missions feelt very silly and did not really fit in with the rest of the game at all. I would personally save those kind of ""filler"" extra silly missions as something you could do after you had finished the game maybe, like some bonus content.   Ok I think that is all for now, great work with the game and I can't wait to see how you will develop this series further!

"2365","As someone who speedruns this game, one of my biggest requests is, that you release an option to play on the older versions of the game.This could be handled through many different ways, such as listing the patches in the 'Beta' tab in the game's properties on Steam, or releasing a tool, which allows us to select the version of the game, that we'd like to play on. I do understand that you don't want anyone to abuse some of this game's bugs, to have the best single-/multiplayer experience possible for all the people who want to enjoy this game casually.If you'd let people play on an old patch, which couldn't connect to the servers for playing online, I do not see any way how it could affect anyone in a negative way though. Everytime you release a patch, I need to ask other people, whether certain glitches, which are used for speedrunning, still work on that version of the game.  Using glitches for the purpose of speedrunning doesn't hurt anyone at all, in my opinion something like this could only make everybody appreciate the game even more.    ","Feature requests",1720

Nearly since the beginning of the release and I know nearly every Secret, Trick or Looting Sites of it, but I am still having fun playing it  But there are still things that would be cool if added: -More takedowns with zombies and people, as well as more parkour/freerunning moves -More weapons for Ultimate Survivor DLC (and by that I mean stronger ones that can do one hit kills), or more weapons for the Dying Light content for more fun I know the listed wishes can be solved by installing mods (by the way I really like it how Dying Light supports mods), but the negative thing on that is, that you can't play on multiplayer with them, unless the others have the same mods installed.I think it's too much that everyone has to install the SAME mods, but my whishes would be cool if fulfilled. I mean you don't even have to add it as content you could add it as a futureDLC (I like 'em  Thank you for reading or even considering my requested wish I have to add that I wish you the best for the future of Dying Light!  Good Night, Good Luck...","Feature requests",1729

"2378","I've seen someone say this before, but I'm going to say it just incase it didn't get noticed. An infection meter and collectible antizin would be a great addition to the game. And here's why: Scavenging - If our infection meter is low and we would like to bring it back up, our need to scavenge and scout would be greatly increased due to for a need of antizin and having to find it.Survival - The search for antizin will boost the game's aspect of survival. We would have a great need to survive and it would greatly boost the theme of survival and scouting more.You may say that it will slow down gameplay and get in the way. On the other hand, one of my friends completed the story in one single night, which means that the game is already fast enough. This infection meter will make the story last throughout days; weeks. I really do insist that you consider this idea. ","Feature requests",1733

"2382","1.How about being able to make your own simple traps instead of those ones made already for you like noose traps use lamp posts or other tall things to attach the pope to put noose on floor zombie walks in it gets hung upside down for easy fun kill or just to slow them down perhaps other traps like trip wire bombs or spring traps were you puch a pool withe attached spike agains wall so when zombie trips the wire it flings out stabing the zombie or flinging it a distance down the street stuff like that here is a link address to image of the trap it: http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/f/f1/Create-a-Tripwire-Trap-Step-4.jpg/900px-Create-a-Tripwire-Trap-Step-4.jpg  seems more real and fun being able to make some of them your self.  2. a negative after completing the game i found areas that had lots of zombies are void of them only few are there some areas have lots of them still but not many it kind of makes it boring the areas need to at least have 10 or 20 zombies in that area or spot make it look more dangerous 3.As your rank goes up you loose ability to get and find older weapons like hatchets all i keep getting are katanas chupacabra swords short swords and some of the new ones i would like accesses to all weapons no matter the rank. 4. how about some weapons that stick zombies to walls or the floor like harpoon guns or metal spears you could make even a net gun which we have in real life already to pin them to the floor or wall even slow them in real life we would make weapons out of anything we could use to fight back or protect ourself like what i said about. 5. one last thing paint or tag pictures you could paint on id of buildings you come across to mark areas for you an co op friends to remember places and for a little fun.","Feature requests",1737
"2383","Hello there. First of all thank you techland for the wonderful game, am still enjoying it. Not a new idea, many players have requested the stuff: infection meter and antizin, only a way to implement them: The concept: Make it into a mission where crane volunteer himself to test a new drug developed by Dr Camden. The drug effect would last longer than the antizin but with some drawbacks: crane will become exhausted (just like during the exhaustion period in rais tower- no hook, only parkour) and he is forced to make a run to supplements or boosters to increase the drug's effectiveness before the reaction completes.  To add to the difficulty: 1. Crane has to make multiple runs (5-10 times) before the drug reaction completes. In each run, an infection meter will appear and he needs to retrieve a booster within a certain time limit. The process will continues until he retrieved all the boosters.  2. The booster locations are guarded either by rais men (what's left of them) or the zombies (include virals, toads and demolisher). Their numbers depend on how many survivors playing together- like the btz/ bozak horde balancing mechanism. Want it to be more difficult? Add night run or change the time to night in the last few runs so that the volatiles can join the party.   The players may be rewarded with new costume/ achievement, etc. Failure to complete the run will cause crane to turn into a zombie (or close to one- just like in the mission in the museum where crane wander aimlessly looking for jade like a zombie but with a twist, an animation where a survivor comes from behind and slash our beloved crane (now a zombie) to death. Thank you for the attention!       ","Feature requests",1738
"2384","Change or update the main missions because i had more fun doing the side missions,for example:(*SPOILERS*)We toke 1 antizin from the box before burning all of them right?Why don't we just give it to rahim or jade when they got bitten,or why did we burn the boxes?(The PIT was after rahims death so yeah the 1 antizin is still on us,and the museum was a joke lol,we killed every guard with weapons,jumped across the zombie pile,killed the zombies before entering the last area and our gear magically disappeared lol and we never knew what happened to the antizin we toke,just don't say that ""well the one that rais throws at you is your antizin""which doesn't make sense)or even better when jade gets bitten ,we get 1 antizin, why don't we use half on crane and the other half on jade that will keep us moving for the next hours,moving on,crane gets bitten when he 1st arrived in haran he gets 1 antizin in the tower and goes on for days without taking antizin,the other runners get bitten and turn in minutes.The ending okay i will live with the QTE because of the running we had to do to get to the top on time,but after the credits we didn't even give the research to camden the doc in the lab,what happened to the research?What happened to camden?Or where is bracken?Bracken and the floating platform next to the bridge just disappeared...Update it add some details or if you are planning for a sequel ok,i think if you update those plot holes or change some missions DL ratings will get 9s and 10s because most of the players quit and judged this game because of that,but overall the gameplay is EPIC!And add random runners/scouts running around haran,because the tower is filled with them but no one is ""running or scouting"" haran or even going after airdrops it will be fun to see random NPC running around.Edited August 17, 2015 by Fr3zZy","Feature requests",1739

But the thing is, she never leaves that position. So, no matter how long you wait, she never leaves. She just sits there, staring at the blood splatter on the wall. Forever.

"2388","Ideas And Feature Requests For Dying Light Developers.","Feature requests",1743
"2389","Hi! I just completed your excellent Dying Light game, your art work and world modeling for this game are quite remarkable. However i want to make some suggestions: 1) Zombie game without dark stinky sewers just lacks some atmosphere. Sewers are used in some story missions, however they are too small and not useful for anything, so the player only use it once or twice during the whole game. Basically thats just art and texturing work down the drain, thats a shame. I suggest to add vast sewer network below Haran, accessible from many points at the surface. I suggest to populate it with zombie swarm, Night Walkers and Volatiles, witch are where all the time, not only at night, provide sewers with night leveling bonus. Add some quests forcing player to go through this horrible areas, make them the only way to reach some important/story places and explore the undercity. Vast dark sewers/caverns/caves, populated with dangerous enemies, surely will be atmospheric. 2) Add some side missions that are random and are called by the radio. Also it would be great if the game world is more fluid and chaotic. Make some random events all around and inform player about new things by the radio contact from the tower or from the other met character. Random missions with random unique rewards and game choices can make campaign and game in general much more enjoyable. 3) Also it would be great to enhance the stealth mechanic allowing true stealthy gameplay. Make some areas purely suicidal without using stealth approach. Good luck and keep up the good work with the game!","Feature requests",1744

"2391","Probably been mentioned, but I'll do it again: Allow folks with developers tools create additional side missions for the maps that already exist.  Have contests for the best ones as voted by the community and then add these missions to the game as a DLC for those of us less technically gifted.  Allow them to exist anywhere along the storyline even the very beginning.As a bonus and incentive allow the authors of the new missions to model their faces and voices into the game!  They play their own character!  If physical modeling and motion capture is too difficult then the mission directive could be given over the radio.Ideas: Dr. Zere needs to try a sample treatment.  The materials are limited so he will have to test and observe the subjects versus spreading bait like he did before.  Find a suitable container and capture several subjects in there.  Go to a pick up location and get the test cure.  Go back to the captured subjects and deploy the test.  Wait a couple of night cycles and return to check the results.There's a report of an unopened air drop in a heavily infested area that Rias' men haven't been able to get to.  It could be an Antizin drop.  Get it.  But wait it's locked with an unpickable lock and only a GRE agent would have the key.  Go get that key.  But who's the other GRE agent I wonder?  And what could be in that box that would only be for a GRE agent?  A silencer?  A lock pick gun to instantly open easy and medium difficulty locks, and make hard and very hard locks easier?  Blueprints?The list could go on and on.","Feature requests",1746
"2392","Sewer idea is also 100% lore friendly, since Virals constantly spawn from the hatches and because night Volatiles also escape at the dusk to some place. Some random character in slums informs player that where are vast sewers beneath Harran and that they can be used to get everywhere, however this is not a case in real game. I understand that combat in closed dark environment could be problematic, and also need analog of safe zone to evade something extremely deadly. My idea is to add flow/flood control valves where, giving ability to just drown crowd of zombies in the specific sector behind you and evade a pursuit. Some areas of sewer may be filled with toxic or flammable gases, providing extra option to hide using gas mask or to fry out some zombies by igniting some flames causing fire or methane gas explosion. Also some human zones where can also been introduced, populated for example by people who hide from surface bandits such as Rais band e.t.c. Sewers can also use existing soundtrack, for example track from old town hotel/bunker will add the excellent atmosphere to such place.Edited August 25, 2015 by Engager","Feature requests",1747

"2394","I think you should through us console players a bone and get us access to your developer tools. You should be able to give verified console players access to the dev tools on steam with access to play custom maps. You could even have custom maps playable on console but just give access to dev tools through steam. I know there are many of us that want access but I figure this is a solution to appease the masses. It sucks that we paid the same as someone on steam but we have less access. Plus you have had several contests that we cannot participate.","Feature requests",1749
"2395","I apologize if this has already been added, cba to read all 85+ pages of ideas to find out.You need a competition mode equivalent to games such as league of legends.With a personal rank, ladders to climb vs other people. If possible, with tournaments and 'pros' in the elite.Make this game a sport, and the people of this world will treat it like a religious sacrament, as we always do with sports. A sport where kids can daydream of being in the elite.. finally scoring with the popular girls in school, and the popular girls can daydream of being in the elite, shocking everyone with her gender as she claims the world title.. a sport where adults and kids play together to achieve something.. the adults whining about the kids whining.. a game where an epic journey (epic by its actual definition, and not the.. purple definition the latest generations seems to have gotten it confused with) up the gory zombiefest ranked ladder..which provides it's journeying heroes with rewards of untold value, inaccessible of lesser skill and quite frankly, value as a human being! It would be epic, it would be dramatic, the god of soundtracks Hans Zimmer himself would surely feel spiritually compelled to craft his greatest masterpiece music of pure heroic carnage to introduce a psychedelic level of immersion only ayahuasca and ibogain can be compared with..It would be an event and experience of biblical proportions .. make sure you reserve the ingame nickname of Jesus Christ himself Techland.. for this is surely the prophesized event of his resurrection and return.. haleluja! Say it with me, HALELUJA! a' one mo' taim, ALELUUJA, oh laawd he's returning, oh yes! mmmmhmm...........;pfelt like chupacabra about a bit, but you get my point tho right? You can add as many truly epic and fantastic expansions, dlc's or sequels as you want. But truth is, they at best only give you a quick gasp of air before going back under, and the timer renews before you run out of breath and community yet again. Get yourself a floaties in form of such a mode as described, where the main compelling content itself is just people trying to climb to top of the pile of people .. you're good. At most all you got to do in that scenario is to make sure it's played fairly an add a new 'map' once a year.. do some gardening in the meantime keeping the scenery alive ..  =p Because I did read a bunch of the comments before giving up on finding this suggestion, and the other members here do indeed have awesome suggestions. Trouble is however.. I suspect with valid reasons that the biggest chunk of your community will fall off out of boredom no more then 2 weeks after release.. tops =/Games today are a reality escape.. the best kinda games are those where people feel they're actually achieving something of personal value with the game they use to escape the reality of the fact that they don't achieve chupacabra in life..mm.. okay, think I've said what I set out to say.. and everything else I just felt like saying, jupp, Im good ;p Keep it up techland, you've created a fantastic game, that is no easy feat in today's competitive market, hope you're proud of that fact  I've gotta head to bed now tho, good night.. and good luck ","Feature requests",1750

I just think firearms should play more of a role. This could be simple stuff to sights and crafting makeshift bullets, to making incindiary, explosive and shock rounds, maybe even suppressors that wear out after so many shots, so they can be used but not abused. I mean i love this game, but it has so much potential to be much more. I even enjoy killing Rais's men, but the conflict with them can be improved so much more as well.","Feature requests",1755

"2406","PLEASE HEAR ME OUT!!!     Hello Dev's. My name is Jay and i'm a veteran in your zombie games. Please consider that I have seen your nature threw previous titles, which were ""Dead Island"" and ""Dead Island Riptide"". I want you guys to have the best and most epic zombie game, but there is still work to be done. I am making a list for you guys that i think you guys need to read carefully.  Things that need to be changed: - The first major issue with the game right now, is the fact that different survivor rankings determine the different weapons. If the player ranks up to the stage (5,10,15,esc) they should unlock more weapons every stage. Instead reaching survivor rank 25 means you will never see: medieval axes, picks, knives, shovels, police batons, so on and so forth. Do you want a game that has flavor?...Then you have to provide it. By removing older weapons as you level up the player will be forced to use the few available weapons at rank 25. Kopesh, fireman axe, wicked bat, and a few â€‹more. You get the point. What if I want a 1,000+ police baton with some cool mods on it. Nope. Can't happen because I'm max rank and no longer have any way of getting it, unless â€‹the dev's realize that this is a serious problem and change it to where you can get any weapon in the game at 1,000+ damage, upon reaching max level. I can load up ""Dead Island"" and grab any weapon i want that has high damage, and usually a legendary or purple.  - Secondly, there needs to be a system in which players are rewarded for their time and effort. (I know bozak horde is out and more dlc is coming), but in addition there needs to be something like: Kill 1,000 zombies this month and get rewarded specialty weapons or random new weapons and can only be obtained threw these new challenges. This would completely distance the game for its predecessors. (in a good way). I would give people more reason to grind and have more fun will feeling rewarded.  - The third issue is kind of big for me. So you guys wanted to create the game around this phrase (""good night, good luck"") that would mean sh*t is going down right? you want people to get scared. Well here's the problem. Volitiles only come out in certain sections a handfull at a time. I find myself hunting them more then they hunt me...because i like killing them, and it feels rewarding, but there is just not enough....instead there are a**holes who run at you and slap you 200x. Not scary. Annoying if anything. Can you guys please make it only, walkers and volitiles at night. Also make them everywhere, so you feel surrounded and scared that you won't make it threw the night. Please remove runners at night and add way more volatiles.   - The last thing on my list. Please put back all the guns you guys cut from the game. There where alot of guns in ""Dead Island"" and ""Dead Island Riptide"". Guns and zombies go together like cookies and milk. From a players standpoint, everyone loves guns so people would really enjoy themselves. From and business standpoint, would bring in alot of new people to the game because gamers often play alot of fps games. I would cry in tears if i seen a ""Gold Tier"" Barrett .50 cal or ""Gold Tier"" handheld mini gun. That would put the icing on the cake. People would love this. Please consider.  â€‹Thank you so much for reading my list of remedies for this beautiful game.I just want the game to be the best and I hope you guys will understand.                                                                                                                                                     ~ Sincerely Jay   Edited September 17, 2015 by Jay","Feature requests",1761

"2410","@JAYHe is right with his ideas......and the problem you say about YOU hunt the night hunters have just to do with the damage of the weapons.....it is to easy on high levels to kill them......thats also the problem of the one hit kill thing.....this game gets to easy in any ways....also night hunter are easy to kill with a 800 dmg weapon......but ok i loom forward, that they now know this problem and try it to fix......this would make the game hard and scary all the time..... and with the police batons and knifes on high lvls.....would be great...on dead island there was no limit of weapons for every lvl.....there where all weapons everytime on every level useable.... and i also hope they change the knife fighting......it is so damn boring when he paints with his knife....stabing would be great...like in Dead Island....there i always used them and it was fun...on dying light i sold every orange knife i find...they are useless now and boring.....i hope for some new fight style with the knifes in the future.....would make it bigger","Feature requests",1765

I know that you can kind of do this at the moment but only to a very basic level. If statements would allow much deeper choices and consequences. ","Feature requests",1768

"2415","What about Water Corpses as a new zombie type...like in RIPTIDE, but more deadlier and agressiv/stealth......would be greatYes! we can hide in the water with no problem but with a water zombie that would be fun the one from dea island scared the heck out of me i want that fear back","Feature requests",1770
"2416","A couple of ideas for new skills for the zombie: Arial tackle - same as the running tackle, but tendrilling in for the tackle.  Can be any forward moving off the ground action, i.e. run and jump, tendril, etc.  To get those guys who camp on lamp posts and walls waiting to rain death upon you.  A higher level skill in the tackle tree. Mutation 2 minimum. Water pound - ground pound in the water.  For the driftwoods.  A higher level skill in the GP tree.  Mutation 1 minimum. Pick up items - be able to move any movable object.  Be able to move canisters from near nests.  Be able to activate and throw canisters.  Move Drop boxes, algea, etc. to keep from getting trapped in places.  A lower level skill in the ""Run Fast"" / ""Tendril Far"" tree. Pounce Defense - be able to passively defend against attacks while in a pounce.  Automatically take less damage during a pounce from other players by using horny masses acquired during mutations.  Each mutation gains additional protections.   Higher level skill under pounce tree. Fast Recovery - recover from a Drop Kick or Pounce miss quicker.  Don't have to wait to hit the ground before recovering.  Under pounce tree. Thanks for listening!Edited September 27, 2015 by SomeOldDude","Feature requests",1771
"2417","Hi guys, This post is about loot containers respawning on Hard mode. I'm playing on Hard difficulty because I like a challenge, not just in combat but also survival. When I first started playing I diligently searched every building and every part of the map for supplies. I find that really enjoyable. But then I noticed containers I had already looted had respawned and instantly that enjoyment was gone because I no longer felt the desperate need to scavenge for survival. There are also quite a lot of supplies. Far from being difficult I find Hard mode too easy. Could you make an option to turn this feature off in the preferences? Or perhaps a DLC? A Survivor mode perhaps? Thank you kindly.Hi guys, This post is about player respawn. I realise this is primarily a multi player game but you have included a single player mode. When I die in single player mode I would like to reload my game, not respawn. I would find this more immersive. It would also be appreciated to be able to manual save in multiple slots. Thank you for your time.","Feature requests",1772
"2418","Hey i want to talk about the survivel feeling for looting in game, which did not exist there..... example: when i start new on hard mode, there after maybe 1-2 hours i have 50 metalparts and 50 alcohol ( also with all other stuff)....and this really really destroyes the SURVIVEL feeling in game...i always got tons of things to craft, without thinking about it is terrible and much much to easy to loot.........thats why i always sold every stuff i got to much, to have just 1 metalpart and alc....but even then after i loot some dead zombies, i get in seconds again 10 metal parts and other stuff.... I remember in the nard mode announce video, that a dev told the looting is much fewer and harder to find things....THATS WRONG..... please i hope for a fix, where we always got from every stuff just a few things and that it is very hard to find things...in a zombie epidamic city, there it must be very hard to find things, but for now it is so damn easy that it kills the fun... this is a must have for HARD MODE....for now hard mode looks like the normal or easy mode.. would be great when there will change something thx","Feature requests",1773
"2419","This thread is the place to post all of your ideas and feature requests for Dying Light development team. We cannot promise you we will implement your ideas, since Dying Light is at a stage where most of the features are already defined and implemented, but we'll definitely consider them. Gamers feedback and wishes are something that we want to be aware of as much as possible. If you wish to discuss any of the ideas posted in this thread, please create an appropriate thread in General Discussions forum and only post a link to it in this thread.I'm sure this has been said, but I didn't read all the way through this topic.. It would be great to have the option to play a female character. Some girls do play games, ya know? ;P I would also love to not get spammed about allowing Night Hunters. I already selected ""no"" in my options for this and getting spammed about it everytime I log in and again when a friend joins me is not cool. Other games charge you a fee to get rid of spam and I already paid to play this game, so I'd appreciate the removal of this.

"2420","Made an account to post ideas for the current game or future Dying Light games   Lean/Cover system: Would be nice and add more gameplay! Equipment Indication: For molotovs and grenades to be precise. Just a visual indicator would be nice, similar to the Uncharted series. Also, C4 please! Camos: Would love to have more customization besides outfits. And not just gun camos, on all weapons! This could also be a chance to add challenges to your weapons and unlock camos.  More loot!: I really really love looting. It would be awesome if you could add even more loot. More loot animations, more models, more interactions. For a lot of players I feel this is huge part of the game, and honestly the more loot the better.  Hope you consider these ideas!  Edited October 1, 2015 by MarcuzXD","Feature requests",1775
"2421","1.  Removed the Timed part of Quests that are not Parkour Challenges. For example: The quest to kill 40 undead for an educational killing tape to help other runners learn how to survive. Timing it makes no since. If you're going to make something to educate other Runners Crane should use a weapons he is comfortable with, taking the time to show Runners on this tape how to kill mobs of Zombies properly. By using all resources available such as Molotoves, throwing stars, etc. Timing something forces mistakes, in a situation with tons of undead the last thing you want is to be careless. You want to be methodical, and make sure you do it right. 2.  Another thing that seems to need address is how the controls at least on PS4 seem to become sluggish when you spawn for any of the timed quests. Its like either Crane has forgotten all he knows or the controls were not tested as well as claimed. A jump Crane has made a million times all the sudden he's no longer able to make. Sprinting in some cases are impossible. I've already broken one controler trying to make him sprit by holding down the left thumb control and not getting a response from the game, and include a cancel option so if you either don't want to finish it you can.3. Allow the Player to drop challenge quests from the Quest menu. I for one and some of my friends just hate these timed quests you've put in the game because of control issues, Cranes response when you start the run and the fact that once you accept it they are on your quest list til the end.4. These so called Legendary blueprints like the Korek machete. First off if the blueprint says its going to do 500 damage and its a Legendary weapons it should do just that. Show up in your bag as an Orange weapon that does 500 damage. Not some common weapon that deals less than what the decription says. Its misleading and wastes materials. In addition to that. Nothing should be exluded from being able to dismantle, destroyed, or sold. I don't want weapons that sit and take up space that could be used for something useful.5.  Allow the player to change the color of that dot you use to make jumps. The white dot is terrible and half the time when you're moving at fast speeds it can't be seen and then you're falling and dying.6. Add Choice. When Crane destroys that Atizin I set the game down for 6 months because it made me hate my character, and didn't pick it back up again until last week. Crane is the must unlikable character in Video Game History. He is like this mindless pawn who doesn't seem capable of making his own choices. There is absolutly no way the GRE would've known if he had just kept the medicine and gave it to the people and neither would've Rias. He could've still walked in and asked for help because obviously that one crate would not sustain the entire tower for the duration of this epidimic. It's a dreadful storyline because Crane doesn't have the ability to make a choice in the matter and for the most part everyone I know only plays the storyline when its absolutly nessassary to gain more XP.7. Add a 3rd Person Camera option. Not everyone who plays these games can deal with the depth perception of FPS. Specially when you don't have periferal vision or the ability to really judge distance. Many game developers like Bethesda add both options and it works out just fine. That way you can appeal to more players. In addition to that it gives the player the ability to actually see these outfits you unlock as you progress. Seems absolutly pointless to put so many in when the only time you see them is in either the player stash or in co-op on another player. 8: Add a manual save option. I have been burned more times than not because of this autosave option and lost out on progress because it was late. I quit the game only to find out I had not reached a save point and lost time played.9: Give the player more choice in how to customize the game.10. Don't lock so much behind this Parkour. Not every player is going to grasp these fancy running concept, and then they are left out of being able to enjoy all aspects of the game that they paid for.

"2423","I know your already working on new map for dying light. But I think it would be cool if you added an area where there was some sort of costume party that was going on. Then when players got there we could fight zombies that are dressed up from simple costumes to the more complex ones. Like zombies dressed up as knights and things like that to make it even more challenging for the players to kill. Also could use that area as a representation of the many holidays. I know its a left field idea but I thought I would mention it.  Thank you for all the hard work and awsome game please keep it up. ","Feature requests",1778
"2424","I know that this idea is unlikely to be implemented, but I'm done keeping it to myself. How about a new monster hunter? Something big and raw like the demolisher perhaps, but make it scarier and stronger. Make it so that it can run and climb likes the survivors (besides tossing rocks and charging like the demolisher) and also able to ground pound. Unlike the night hunter that can insta-kill@pounce while survivors at full health, the new monster will need to lower the survivor's health (let say below 50%) before it can do the same by ripping them apart into pieces (you guys are good with the animation stuff). This will encourage the monster to get close and constantly aggressive as it should be. Obviously it will have higher hp than the current hunter and thus take few more hits before dying. When the health is low, the monster can leap quite far to escape (if the player managed to do so). It doesn't need spit cause the charge and leap-pound are enough for this monster, but still u can do one like toxic breath, etc. Survivor's combo u say? For this monster u need to have at least two survivors simultaneously jumping on top of it to initiate the rain on death and dropkick animations, anything less than that, it will only stagger the monster for a very brief moment. You can sell it as a new dlc, just saying. Come on, u guys have all the things, I mean existing stuff that need to be modded to implement this idea. Plus u are giving us new firearms in the coming dlc right, at least the survivors will have something to shoot at during the pvp. Right, I heard that the new map will be as large as the two combined (slums and old town). With few buildings to climb on and the need for buggy to traverse the whole area, a new monster against 4 survivors in buggies will keep us hooked for a long time! After we finished with the quest of course. Thanks for reading this, cheers Edited October 7, 2015 by EnlightenMe","Feature requests",1779

(with undead pirahnas and bikini's!)- undead aliens ! ok it s sound stupid, but alien are always good to add ... maybe they're true responsible for the zombinfection ?- CHAINSAWS !!! (one handed, two handed, electric or not, etc ...) with the same customization level than melee weapons- snow maps / environment ?- more zombies (regular ones / baddasses)- superior zombies with ranged weapons ?- more story quest !- more dying light !- DL 2 ? thank you for reading, more to come as i'll loose my RL time in this wonderfull game !  PS: plz forgive bad spelling, grammar, etc .. since english is'nt my native language     ","Feature requests",1787
"2433","dear developers, i recently purchased dying light and i must tell you guys this is an amazing accomplishment. the game is relentless and it's fighting and survival systems are truly addictive and utterly immersive. i bought the game along with my ps4 console, in brazil, and i would love to tell you guys about the things that pushed me away from the game quite a few times. i always came back to harran, though, and as kyle kept getting stronger and better your game was more and more fun to play. but, still, there's a few issues (please, bear in mind i have my console for two weeks and i couldn't connect it to internet so i'm not playing the last patch): 1. i know the game is built to be relentless and hard, but the parkour tutorial is a joke, it takes a LONG time to master even the most basic free run on the game and the missions that help you do it are not well presented as a narrative need (as something that'll make the narrative move forward, specially character wise - the last far cry game did very well despite it's fragile character, you get introduced to the different types of missions and actions in the beggining of the game, after that, you're left on your own). i read a lot of threads on the internet because i lost track of the plot even before the second mission, i didin't undertand the day and night cycle clearly and the side quests system until i was in old town and jade was dying and i didn't care, because i had seen her once or twice before. in the forums i read this was because the game was hard and that's not true, this game (and the next games you guys develop) deserves a narrative system as good as the game is. this would be accomplished with simple lines in early scenes or just better writing i.e. to chase rahim through roof tops. to make an errand with somebody (thinking of the game's plot, kyle has to prove himself but nothing helps you build up your fame, really).  2. stealth: rais soldiers can spot me from miles away, they can even sense me as i slowly crawl down the back of a bulding to try to get an angle on them, i can't even jump on one of them as they ALWAYS know where i am. How does that work??? this is a MAJOR issue to me and it is, truly, the most irritating aspect of the whole game. it took me a while to notice the markers on the minimap turning yellow and red, but it doesn't makes anysense. at night it itsn't the flashlight that exposes me. it isn't the sounds i make, also, even though i'm crawling behind a van, the guy will ALWAYS sense me (he almost NEVER SPOTS me). so i got a takedown skill to have fun with a zombie horde only? i'm playing this game for longs periods of time and everytime i try to sneak away from soldiers with guns, even if they are more them 150mts away, THAY CAN SPOT ME. HOW?!!! this is not hard, this is just senseless. 3. gunplay: i know the game's great fun is melee weapons, but i have to takedown armed soldiers pretty early on the game, so i have to use guns at some point and despite me getting used with the controls they are just the worst part of gameplay. the shotgun and military rifle are a little better to aim and handle but i would understand these controls on a character that didn't know how to handle a gun. a simple way of helping is with the crossmark thingy turned red to indicate impact on the firing from the hip mode. 4. color system: again, no in game tutorial or whatever about the weapons kind, crafting, repair and upgrade system, i didn't know what the different colors where all about, i had an idea but i was lost for the first 11 hours, dying non stop. 5. looting: great looting system, not that rewarding though, i spent more than a fair share of my game time picking up locks and opening chests to find out more lockpickers inside. it doesn't make any sense that somebody would lock a crowbar in a clothes chest. or that i woul spend half a day picking a  very hard lock to find a piece of plastic inside. it's not that rewarding for 80% of the time. i know this i about survival but sometimes this only makes the game feel ridiculous. or it made ME feel ridiculous exploring, fighting zombies to get an used cellphone. so, until i got better skilled on the game i didn't go looting for almost nothing, and i LOVE picking up the locks in the minigame you developed. 6. parkour: it takes a while to really be able to climb and run around without feeling like an idiot by breaking your legs every three minutes and a half or so. again: kyle is a GRE operative, a merc or something, he is not the guy from far cry 3, jason, who has to learn everything, the games hard learning curve is really nice, but i think it is focused on the a few wrong concepts. still it is an amazing feat and it can be rewarding as kyle finally gets better at basic stuff, but at the beginning it even pushes the character kyle away from me, he doesn't have to re-learn things to be undercover, he simply sucks at stuff as the game begins. its a joy to freerun around old town climbing averything, but kyle sometimes would take 30min to enter a window no matter what you do. even pointing the camera to the indoors won't take me inside as kyle simply jumps over the window again and again. such a nice parkour system should run smooth and i hope you guys can fix this bugs to make this a better game. Oh! i almost forgot, tic tac is really nice and helpful but you should really add a wall run system. this wold make the gameplay a peach. 7. portuguese version only: here in brazil dying light is being sold in PORTUGUESE ONLY copies. this is awful, specially for me, playing an adult game. the voice acting is extremely poor and made in a way that we loose track of distance and direction. it is poorly translated as well. i think you should not release the game in a portuguese only version, it should be a consummer's choice. thanks a lot for your time and for the games you guys made!krmchl","Feature requests",1788
"2434","hi, i forgot a couple of things on my previous post: fear: i've experienced fear during nights but the little girls that scream are the scariest part of the game. the sound of their crying made me goosebumps. they're even scarier than the volatiles. after a while the game just puts exploding zombies and those spitting frogs SoBs so you have to run, climb and attack them quickly, this gets a bit old early in the game. peek: you should add a peek mode, for the shooting part the cover and shoot system of wolfenstein is pretty sweet and it would help a lot against human foes. that's that!","Feature requests",1789

"2436","these are from other forums from me I started Outfits / weapons / vehicle / other I would love to fight as the Michelin man and have a weapon to throw or hit zombies with tires. being a robot with a chainsaw spraying blood everywhere would be cool. a yellow Vespa ss 180 with a blue Rickenbacker 4001 left handed electric bass guitar would be awesome. a brick in a purse or hitting zombies with stuffed toys would be funny to kill a zombie with. chucking a trident to pin a zombie together or to a wall would be fun. flamethrowers, its a zombie apocalypse why not. on Halloween next year id love to turn into a werewolf being able to rip zombies limb from limb. a trophies for staring up a zombies skirt or a males zombies butt would be funny. another weapon id love to see would be one from a anime scryed where he can turn his fist into a explosive weapon. a death costume with a scythe would be ironic. a pokey stick to poke zombies with would be fun. I think I speak for all my friends and people I played dying light with a boomerang blade that was actually a boomerang and came back. kicking a zombie between the legs would be funny. another fun weapon to play with would be a weapon that locked onto a certain body part and made it disintegrate so you could make a zombie like the black night from Monty python. a stealth ability for both humans and night hunters like one of the humans is a sniper so he can barely show on map and it would only give a general area or direction something like this for a night hunter too so they cant complain that were too over powered. I would love a way to put in your own sword designs to help you with the design process of weapons. different objectives dying lights pvm is quite good but it is severly lacking in pvp. my suggestion is to make its pvp more like left 4 dead. such as one person cant use a grappling hook or anything but has to carry a item to a certain point. another option would be a protect mission where they have to protect a person or place from the night hunter from hitting it until they get the power back on. night hunter vs night hunter pvp its not likely that all night hunter will like all night hunters so they might have turf wars and of course who doesn't want human vs human pvp. with the new map there will be vehicles so why not make the night hunter into some giant elephant like thing while the humans race to a points trying to get first and not to die. another fun one would be multiple races on foot trying to gather info on how to get to some type of safe zone since all the power went out. the ability to as a night hunter to become faster or stronger by eating there own nests would be cool and last one I had on the two forums I started was a last man standing so the longer you survive the greater the rewards.","Feature requests",1791
"2437","Hello, I would like to have the game settings option to modify the buttons, some are not used as much as others, so you could add a quick button for a more important skill, I would also like to be able to use several buttons to launch secondary weapons and not having to left cross and right trigger select, I can do it because I have practiced but at first it was very hard, as an example when you fight against a hunter there is no time if you're a beginner player to change lamp, flares, hook, etc ., my choice and I speak for many players would be able to leave the lamp to the left trigger and cross a command down and press to select a preconfigured button  Y (hook), B (booster), X (flares) A (shield) to launch Immediately. hope will serve for the future of the game, it would be great, greetings ...","Feature requests",1792
"2438","Sorry for bad english. 1. Disable Le Jedi Force Push for that big guys with 2 handed weapon. Tired of every time being hit by that damned ***er somehow from 2 meters distance between my character and the place in which he have hit. 2. Give option for auto lock-opening. Every auto lock-opening cost some amount of picklocks. Like for easy -5, hard -10, very hard - 15. Because why wasting time for every lock? There is literally no point on lock-opening of random chest right now (except very hard, and hard locks police cars in Old Town, and new chests in quarantine), because no matter what inside - it not worth of time. 3. Add special store with high prices for rare items like weapons mods, medkits, etc. But char can buy them indefinitely. Right now I almost beat the game for second time, and again, my chat have 230000+ dollars with nothing to spend for. But yet he is still need to loot garbage bins for ropes and general stores for alcohols... That makes no sense. Why ""legend of Harran"" can't just buy anything he need? I mean, ok, it zombi and stuff, but its lead only to very high prices for general supplies like alcohols and ropes and others, and not to complete absence of all of this in stores. Make this special store opening after some general quests, or after one quest but specifically for opening that store. And make prices start very hight at fist. but player can take discount, eventually. For example make prices in special store depends of how many air drops player turns in - that will be reducing prices for medkids, and stuff alike. How many moneys player have spend at all in that store, globally - reduce prices overall. How many survivors character have saved - reduced cost for weapon mods. Or as alternative make a bunch of repeating quest which will be giving store owner to the character, and every specific quest will be reduce price for specific type of items. This will make sense, and also it will provide a place in which char can spend all that money for buying something useful. 4. Please, fix crafting. Make crafting stations in safe areas, which will providing mass production in one click and instant. Slow crafting as it now, is makes sense only for combat situations. 5. Instant loot, at least on ng+.  Watching how char is picking stuff or slowly opening chest was nice for first 100000000 times, but after that...not so much. 6. Fewer placed to loot crafting stuff, but make them much specific, and with increased quantity of items.  I mean picking 1-2 bottles of alcohol here and there is ok, but it will better if there will be not 10 spots for loot alcohol by 1 bottle, but 1 spot with all 10 bottles. Like bar with a lot of alcohol in backrooms, or if this drug store - make it to have a lot of medkind, med stuff. If it weapons store - make it have a lot of bullets. And every one of it placed need to have heavy guarding. For example, unlooted bar have big zombies inside, weapon store is dead locked behide anti-thief's iron shields on windows, like literally, player need to find a way in. And need to decide do it even worth it. 7. Please, please, fix GPS guided virals. Right now they are charging right into player if char farted to loud. And will pursue player around all map, and even if player outrun them on 700m and hiding somewhere, they are still with help of GPS will be aware of player location and eventually will catch up to the player if stand still. Make them charge to the location in which char has make loud sound, and then search area for player. And if player already outruned them a lot, make them to pass near hiding player because they lost they sight on him.","Feature requests",1793

There's a LOT of the history to be explored. Seeing Harran falling to the zombies would be awesome ( not really, but amazing If you got me ). Also, man... why Jade died? She's badass... and I think a lot of us wanted to see her in action!

"2453","I didn't realize till after I made an account that this thread was initially created for request before the game released. Also, I'm going to try to recommend changes that in the realms of being patched in and not something that obviously requires a whole new game installment/sequel. This will also be in-line with what has already been confirmed to be in The Following expansion (as of 12/5/15). - Backpack Some people have mentioned this, for a game that acts mostly realistic, it is rather far unrealistic to carry a whole bunch of items from nowhere. Especially considering the generation we are in now, this shouldn't really be a thing anymore. Of course not every single item can fit in the backpack, even The Last of Us suffers from this a bit, but it helps to make the game more realistic overall. - Trade System Between Weapons/etcI'm sure you guys are aware of and have played or seen enough of the Borderlands series. It's also a open-world, 1-4 person, RPG action game. (Difference being it's heavily more involved with shooting while Dying Light is to survival.) In that game, you can trade weapons and give money to your partners precisely. Money would be nice, but weapons and certain other items have priority here for DL. The way this game was designed entirely, it should have a trading system by default. We should be able to trade weapons (may'be blue-prints and supplies/valuables/etc) to our friends via a legit established in game trading system. The ""dropping system"" does its job good but it doesn't create or give us the proper feeling that it should in this kind of game and world. - Silencers for gunsOf course so it's not a flawed system, this would also mean making changes to the human enemies who have guns to also have silencers. I don't think that's too much of a problem to add though. So the game isn't heavily a shooter, but there's enough gun relevance (alerting zombies, human enemies having guns) and roles (player being able to have one and use at any given time they like, outside the safe zone ofc) for guns in this game to have silencers. Of course silencers cannot be placed on the Anti-Godoid and Double Barrel Shotgun (unless i'm ignorant) so it's fine if it's absent from those weapons. (In case something similar) ""This would break the immersion or tension that players get when they fire the guns because the zombies would hear it and go after them."" True, but when has this stopped other zombie games for having silencers on their - (One of the most important) Seeing a display image/icon of weaponsThis is also something else Borderlands has, and i'm very very surprised Dying Light didn't have when I first picked it up. Additionally, it legitimately feels like this game is incomplete or missing something essential without this mechanic. You have all these different type of weapons in the game, but when you're about to buy one, you can't see what it looks like - to any degree - before you purchase it. When you're cycling through your inventory, you can't see what your weapons look like without being forced to equip it to then see it in the human character's hand. It's overall really disappointing and the game should have some kind of feature for this mechanic.  - Stricter swimming mechanicsWhen I first noticed you could jump out of water while swimming and even being able to kick in mid-air after jumping out at that, I was a bit upset, but I let it slide. Nothing game-breaking. However, after encouraging 3 friends to buy the game (which they waited till Black Friday to do so - all new copies btw) and then having playing with them, I took them to the rock to get the Excalibur (after having done other missions first of course) and while we were swimming, they jumped out of the water and made remarks like ""this isn't realistic, lol"", ""there is nothing realistic about this, lol"", ""so much for realism.. you couldn't do this in real life"". Kind of altered the fun and experience while we were playing the game. They each had something to say about it and after some thinking on my part, I knew the changes needed to fix this wouldn't be much at all.  Of course this change isn't a major deal, but it helps to make the game more realistic and respectable, alongside some of the actual realistic aspects of the game (just going to have to let the Grappling Hook and Dropkick slide on this one) already. Mostly everything else I and others want are already being added to the expansion such as transportation vehicles to get around the world, a crossbow, new weapons, etc. Thank you for everything so far, Techland.

"2457","Hey Techland! I have a really neat idea for when The Following Comes out. I believe that there should be perks implemented with what outfit you wear. For instance, the Mercenary outfit should help with guns, the Ninja outfit should have something to do with stealth and or speed or walking, running, climbing, and throwing stars etc. speed. If your representating your country by wearing country specific uniform it should also give you some type of advantage. And like the zombies that have special uniforms such as the Hazmat and the Fireman uniforms, we should be able to wear them as well by getting that outfit at random from searching their corpse after killing them. Then you could put special crates inside places that have acid around them and make us wear the hazmat suit to get to them. And not be affected by our own acid weapons. Then we could be Fire retardant when wearing the fire suit for similar purposes. You obviously see where I'm going with this and I had to share this idea with you all at Techland because I believe it is a great idea that would make this game even more fresh once The Following releases.

"2468","Giving the zombies the ability to open doors . Depending on the type of infected, they can open more or less easily. Simple biter, for example, will struggle to break down a door by itself (it will eventually succeed), several biters however (at least two of them), the door will open faster. The virals, will open more quickly. And volatile will smash the doors without effort.  I would love this idea to be implemented in the game (why not only in nightmare difficulty ?) so that the player does not feel safe just because he closed a door. Edited January 7, 2016 by Vektor_Noirsang","Feature requests",1823
"2469","Another idea for the nightmare mode. A range of vision, enhanced for volatile (and enemy in general) but which is reduced when the player is crouching.  Another thing, the flashlight is used with some restraint. Infected sees the light in the form of a discrete red, with a much smaller range than humans. However, it remains visible to them at a certain distance, so it could be a source of problem, if an infected came to perceive it.In other words, short / medium range, they seek the source of light. the Night for now is to just run while spamming the survivor sense, it's too bad. How I can be frightened by monsters deaf and blind and that I can quite easily kill ? I hope the ""nigthmare difficulty"" is and will remain a challenge for players who are max level. ""Hunter By Day, Prey by night "".These words must not be forgotten, it must remain so, no matter what. ""Hunter by day, Hunter by night"" It is not interesting and it breaks the principle of the game.","Feature requests",1824

"2471","Would be super cool if we would get ANIMAL ZOMBIES like in Z Nation zombie series (my favorite zombie tv-series). For example big bear or gorilla zombies would be super cool. Also more little zombie animals would be cool. Hopefully we see more GRE in future also. It reminds me somehow of Umbrella Corporation in Resident Evil series and it (unethical corporation making zombie virus tests) worked there very well.   Thank you a lot for Dying Light, best game I have ever played. I hope you make Dying Light 2 for PC also. This game is way too good to be ended after Dying Light (1).","Feature requests",1826
"2472","Request: Support for virtual reality for future expansion, and small current feedback. Hello, I played 62 hours in the singleplayer campaign (main story and side quests) with the experimental VR support that currently has the game.(Oculus dk2).The game seemed to me simply stunning from this perspective, it is fantastic, and the part that I enjoyed more missions are indoors, both secondary and main story. The current support is weaker as the positional tracking, or the difficulty of reading the text of the table of skills, but still  95% was playable for me. I wanted to leave this little feedback request also with a view to future expansion the following:1: A good solution to the problem of text in current devkit 2 Oculus is to change the current color of the text of the description of skills.A perfect for this color is green, very significantly improves the viewing and reading text, and also believe that green makes sense with the game lore.This improvement could be applied both Dying light,as to the future expansion-The following. 2: Possible compilation with the sdk / runtime Oculus? Last for PC windows (0.7 or 0.8) might be a good idea.These new runtimes, now work much better with the direct mode.At present,no need for settings in extended mode, now is not necessary.On the other hand, new Nvidia drivers have also received new features for this. 3: Enable tracking postional, I'm not sure if this will be possible, or maybe the current problem to avoid this active function may be collision problems.In any case I leave it as the third point. If any of this possible, please appreciate that at least we can enjoy Dying Light and future expansion-The following dk2 VR with in the same way they have been doing until now.Greeting and sorry my english.  ","Feature requests",1827
"2473","To Dying Light team Thanks for creating one of the best open-world survival games ever! Ideas and RequestsI have seen a lot of requests to make the game harder.One of the ideas I have, is to use one of those devises that measure Radiation  ( DETECTION AND MEASUREMENT OF RADIOACTIVITY ).With this devise you will need to: check the radiation levels of areas and make sure you dont stay in the area for too long, or add a new mutated zombie (A zombie just as badass as the juggernaut) that made its nest in a ""nuclear power plant"", or that ate something radioactive. The requests that I want to make is to ask the Developers ot add a potato gun(CO2 Launcher) to the game as a portable weapon and a car/buggy mounted weapon.The reason why I am asking for a potato gun is not to make the game easier,but more fun and interesting. Becease a potato gun is not really a deadly weapon, the player can do multiple upgades to increase the CO2 capacity to make it stronger(increase shot distance) and increase number of shots.Upgrading the gun will unlock slots to load different things making it not the strongest but the most versatile and fun to use. The gun will not use many new items, but most of the existing items like: potatos,flares,molatov,firecrackers(or tin of meat to attract zombie, it should last longer than the firecrackers),different granades and glowing paint to mark moving targets.  Potato Gun Damage (CO2 capacity - 1 shot per unit)level 1 - The potato gun should do low damage when shooting a potato ( CO2-20 )upgrade to level 2 - Unlocks flares,molatovs and firecrackers or tin of meat ( CO2-30 )upgrade to level 3 - Unlocks glowing paint and adds impact damage to the item shot ( CO2-40 )upgrade to level 4 - Unlocks granades ( CO2-50 )  I would like to here what the team thinks of the potato gun ideacontact me at   wolff.khvz@gmail.comEdited January 14, 2016 by SilverWolff88","Feature requests",1828
"2474","Amazing game guys! Keep up the good work! Now, lets talk about weapon mods. They're a bunch of them but they all basically do the same exact thing: Bleeding, toxic, freezing, fire, and electric. Not to mention most of the top weapon mods are almost the same visually, stat wise, and effects. Maybe in the next one you could cut the number of weapon mods down, and introduce more unique ones. I haven't tried some of the special DLC ones you have, but those seem to be more interesting that just fire/electric. At least visually. You don't need to be too zangy either. ","Feature requests",1829
"2475","I'll be honest, I didn't read all 88 pages so I may request somethings that have been asked for already. PVP for Consoles - You have just released PVP for PCs. This has been an addition I've wanted from the first time I fought one of Rais thugs. It would be great if you could add 5-6 maps and maybe 3 game modes.Rumble (Free For All)Team Death MatchCapture the Safe Zones (Capture the flag derivative: Two 4v4 (6v6) teams pitted against each other who gain points for capturing and holding safe zones. AI would be included in this as well and would play a role in this mode. There would be a shortened day/night cycle as well with emphasis of having safe zones to be in. Night time would be insane with tons of Volatile and every other zombie roaming the streets and roof tops. Emphasis would be on capturing and holding safe zones.)VIP Protect - Large scaled Be The Zombie Game Mode with different rule set, and two Night Hunters. A team of humans, 5 escorts and 1 VIP. The VIP is only equipped with lockpicks and UV light to start. The humans all start with the same load out. UV lights, 5x firecrackers,  and machetes. Each checkpoint will have a locked box, which will have better gear that only the VIP can open. Each box will have its own set of equipment that gets better each time you reach a new checkpoint. The boxes get harder to open as well with each one ranging from easy to very hard. The VIP will recieve the highest level gear, while the escorts will recieve lower quality items. The main mission is to keep the VIP alive. If he dies, the game is over. If the VIP reaches the final checkpoint, the game is over. Other than that it could have a certain amount of deaths on either side for the game to end. Humans prize could be just like Be the Zombie but give a better chance of yellows to the VIP since its the harder job.Obviously this is an incredibly large undertaking and maybe your framework doesn't support this. However, it could potentially add hundreds of hours of game play for many people. This could also draw in another source of income for you, since I have plenty of friends who are turned off by this game based off the pure fact you don't offer PVP. 2.) Range Weapon - I know this may be addressed in the new DLC coming out, but ranged weapons aren't show cased enough. The lack of killing from distances is really a major drawback for me. One of Dying Lights biggest pro's is the ability to kill zombies in a multitude of ways. However, I think you missed the target with distance weapons. It doesn't make any sense that a lower survivor level can find weapons with higher damage outputs. Weapons drop like candy at higher levels, AND at better a tier. Why make an Orange Police Rifle that only does 184 when I can just use the 280 one I found at level 5? Add a scope to ONE gun. Give us the ability to play sniper and protect friends. In EVERY Zombie related game/movie there is ALWAYS a marksman. Someone who is good with a gun from range. Sniping is a huge part of many FPS games. Please give us the ability to snipe them from longer ranges. You could make a scope a Blue Print that you find at the end of the game for all I care, just make it available. Throwable weapons need more variety and need more love. I love playing as a Ninja, who silently and quickly dispatches enemies. I love to dawn my Ninja costume, grab my Katana, Bow, Modern Axes, and some Firecrackers and go out to town. The number of higher damage throwables just isn't there. You give us the ability to craft throwing stars with different elements, but don't extend that to the other weapons? Please, allow us to mod or add more variety into the throwable category.","Feature requests",1830
"2476","Hope anyone from Techland read this  1) Arena for players, PvP is great idea, I would really enjoy fighting with my friends. 2) Multiple crafting, because I don't want let my Enter die when I can craft 90x Aid Kit. 3) Restore previous equipment, it's really annoying when I got out from Bozak and have to get my equipment all over again. 4) Option to delete maximum level, cause when I finish everything there's nothing to do. Thanks for reading!Edited January 14, 2016 by wezu123","Feature requests",1831
"2477","Weapon Viewer Request - ability to preview weapons in 3d from your inventory. Some of the weapons are so cool looking, but you hide them from us. I'm assuming you have 3d models for everything already since all the weapons can be seen when on the ground - so why not make a previewer? Our Inventory houses all our weapons. It would be nice if you could hover over your weapon, open up the Upgrade Menu where you could insert clicker, kings, etc, and at the bottom have a button for preview. This would display your weapon as a 3d model with the ability to twist and tilt it. Your model forces people to use many different types of weapons.You limit the durability on a weapon, making it only last so long.You have over 180+ weapons in the game.You create Blue Prints that are supposed to give unique bonuses to weaponsModifying and Upgrading weapons is supposed to be a huge part of this gameSo with all of the mechanics you've introduced that is supposed to create diversity and more unique gameplay - you don't even allow us to enjoy them. It would be great to see how the Angel Swords modifications are setup different then the Electricutters is, or just see how it is even modded on our weapons. Some weapons have cool art that you can't enjoy cause you can barely see it. Allow us to see what the hell we are using before equipping it. Most games that have weapons have some sort of previewer of a weapon, so you know what it looks like. BF4, Destiny, Fallout, COD, etc. Just Dying Light doesn't and it could greatly benefit from it. Obviously it would be nice if each modification had a different visual. I'm guessing that isn't the case for all blue prints, but it would be cool to see different art for each weapon. Really give meaning to the blue prints.","Feature requests",1832

"2479","WILDLIFE ZOMBIFIED I become a big fan of this game since I killed my very first zombie in the game, I bought season pass mainly because the ninja outfit and ever since that moment techland hadnÂ´t stop surprised me with all the dlc content, and now with the big expansion of ""the following"" my hype is out of the charts, but when I watch the gameplay I noticed there is no wildlife even in the country side, imagine the following: You are in your boogie leaving all low zombies behind, and then a pack o 3-5 rotten wolves start chasing you at boogie speed! or listening the roar of a mighty zombie bear at 10ft away, mount caguars, spiders, crows that cant shred you at night if you are not in the boogie or in the light, I really hope to see some wildlife in the dlc to add more challenge, or at least another dllc of new enemies in the future, what do you guys think?

"2482","Hello, Everyone! Finally took the time to make an account here, After reading a great deal of this topic its amazing with all the cool ideas people are coming up with. However i myself feel like i have quite a reasonable request and if this has been asked before then please....Forgive me lol. I want to talk about the DEVtools, If this is the wrong place to do it bare with me, Don't get me wrong. The tools are awesome and the stuff people make is proof of that but what i and many MANY other people have been asking for is the ability to add custom projects into the live game. Personally, I have no idea why this feature didn't launch with the tools. Think all the custom Quests, Areas and other content we are missing out on just because we don't have this simple feature. There are people out there right now working on vast Dying Light projects basically trying to re-make the game just so they have a Verson they can edit and build on and i think that's crazy sad. We didn''t want tools so that you could make some silly crash course outside of the game for you to waste 10mins on.( No offense to the people that do enjoy that ) We wanted to help add on and build the game with you guys. When news 1st came out about "" DEVtools"" it was a big ray of hope that we would get legit modding tools for the game, Seriously go on YouTube and look up the videos of people being crazy excited that mods would be coming. When the tools came out, It was a massive slap in the face because all you could do was "" Make Maps "" most of the hopeful and passionate modding community on nexus died instantly and then they are some die-hards like me hoping for the day you add this amazing but simple feature. So please, For the sake of a better dying light and on behalf of what's left of the modding community, Give us a 2nd chance after the following has come out to grant us this option. thanks for your time and sorry for the wall of text. It needed to be said.","Feature requests",1837

And cannot find how to turn it off.I may propose next idea -Make an official DLLauncher (or somehing like it) that will contains some options like in Dying Light Manager (http://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight/mods/18/?). It doesn't work properly with the last patch of DL. There's a lot of interesting functions that may help people to improve their PC performance or game stability, like in my case.e.g. ""Rendering Reflections"" - its so good to help the gpu in game because practically all PC's now have a gpu bottleneck..If I can ""Disable Screendrops"" - I would get superior picture on my screen without flickerings etc.   Best Regardsklo4koandrew ","Feature requests",1839
"2485","To be honest Dying light is a great game and the developers are fantastic! I am polish myself and I thought about things that can be improved and added in the game as I have finished the game anyways and I am looking forward to more content in the future. Lets begin: 1. I thought about adding upgrades to guns would be nice for example giving the guns a torch, laser, different sights, increased magazine capacity and maybe even silencers? Would make the fire arms more deadly. Or even give the guns a little colour or style by making them different from the original. 2. In game character armour maybe? It would also be nice to recruit people to help you and even make your own gang for money and supplies. It would also be nice if you could build your own house on the country side (the following dlc) and make your own armoury where your weapons and clothes can be stored etc. 3. By playing the game for over 50 hours I didn't see any people or zombies or any kind of military clue of where they could of been so it would be nicer if you could have zombies from the military and abandoned vehicles like military jeep or abandoned tanks to make dying light slightly interesting. 4. Adding a gun like the revolver would be nice as the only handguns in game are the American pistol and german pistol so why not add a revolver? 5.Maybe having your own companion would help like having a dog in the game or something? That's all I could think of improving the game for now. I dziekuje mam nadzieje ze you are going to read this.Thank you/dziekuje","Feature requests",1840

"2487","Hi, I have here some good requests for this game. Everything what i mention here is My opinion what i share with my friends. First of all... My english isnt the best but im trying to write currectly. What we realy need see in game is better Shields... Why better shields ? Becose they are realy useless in this moment, they are break realy easly, and without extra good usefull in combat with something/somebody. Maybe if you add them some durability (or u add repairing of them) its will be nice, but what they are really need is using something with tham in combo... like knifes, or one handed weapons... u know if you can use them and cut enemies in half ... it can be nice (for balance u can for example add faster stamina lost). Next thing what we really need is something trowable what auto get back. Like boomerang. Please add these shields becose we really need them in game, and in my opinion... this update get more player to using shields ...","Feature requests",1842
"2488","I would like to see more zombie art work and zombies in general.  I think you should have some zombie females with hair as well.  I noticed a lot of the women zombies don't have hair on their heads.  I think the ability to play other genders sometime in dying light such as Dying Light 2 where it wont get fowled up by the campaign as playing a male so you can attract a bigger audience.  I think they can possible make this a lot like the walking dead show but make it different and a lot of fun.  Character customization as well sounds like a nice addition if possible.","Feature requests",1843
"2489","Bozak horde sequel with harder challenges and stronger/faster zombies. A sniper rifle. Firearms attachments/blueprints. Drones. Easter update with Easter egg disguised bombs. 4th of July update with baseball bat blueprint that has a chance of sending a zombie flying in a direction and exploding into fireworks. New grapple mechanics (throwing zombies over railings, off of building tops, etc). Player versus player arena (similar to dark souls). New outfits (biologist, trigger happy, etc).","Feature requests",1844
"2490","I'd love to see an online ""Hunger Games"" type mode where people are given the same blueprints and they have to go out and scavenge for weapons and medkits while struggling to be the last man standing. Then get in game rewards for your campaign in a similar way that the Bozak Horde works with its tickets.","Feature requests",1845
"2491","I would like to see some sort of freezing attachment to weapons that can either freeze or slowdown movement on hits. And cuz i notice i allways have plenty money and nothing good to spend it on, then we could maybe have safe house u can buy from local npc's or buy parts to upgrade and build safehouses, to maybe costumize your own little house u like that you can show to ppl joining your game? i think u can tinker something with that idea  And for the buggie (car) how about chainsaws on the sides or something sharp to just cut off legs in highspeed for some awesome gore? and for weapon idea maybe blowdarts for silent sleeping effect? <-- not best idea but just a thought xD Im sure that many have also said something about cosmetics for your character that isnt a complete outfit to make yourself more uniqe, like beeing able to cosmetic changes on your shoes,masks,jacket,pants etc. But mostly on hardmode wich i play the most on u dont rly have much to spend your money on cuz u cant buy bullets or materials except for weapons wich i dont rly do cuz there are not many good items at the stores, so something that i would want to spend money on cuz i dont like to have much money xD i would want to hunt for more money if i get broke  It keeps me going ","Feature requests",1846

"2493","I would love to see the ability to build or board up a safe house in the coop gameplay... that way you and your 3 friends can roam around find a good building and then hunker down... and then zombies attack your base at night... if it isn't strongly built then they have a chance to get in... at that point you have too fight them off or run... Maybe have a sewer system exit as a get away? Traps just in case they get in? that kind of thing, makes the coop game-play more team oriented... 3 people go out in the day time 1 stands guard they have too pick up supply's to re-enforce the base... At night if one of your guys gets caught out and makes a break for the safe house but ends up attracting a horde... he gets in the safe house but the horde starts attacking the safe house to which you then have too hope your safe house holds (unlikely) or you all escape...  Would this be possible? I agree with Suisidel we should be able to build our own bases.It would add more excitement to the game.","Feature requests",1848
"2494","What I would like to see is more weapons, and something to let us carry more ammo. Also I thought that the glowing sicle and machete were really cool. Those weapons have that cool effect that made me honestly come back to the game and play it for another month or so.  It gave those weapons a cooler and less dull look. One thing that I think would be a cool feature is actually stabbing enemies with bladded weapons.  For example takeing the katana and stabbing a zombie then once it falls to its knees just kick it and pull out the blade. One more thing that I think would be kinda cool is impact branded tied to ballons as a craft. I can just imagine haveing 10 helium balloons above a group of zombies then shooting the balloons with an assault rifle and make it rain. Anyway I still like the game and think it's one of the best zombie games I have played.","Feature requests",1849
"2495","I'd like to see a survival mode. Some type of a game where you can't win and difficulty increases all the way up. Dying Light is a great game but it becomes boring after you passed all the quests multiple times. So I end up just wandering here and there during nights and see how long I can survive on the ground with four pursuit stars and more than often I'm able to survive until dawn, that's frustrating. This game becomes too easy after a while. Ideally I'm thinking about something like a place or an NPC that you should protect against approaching waves of zombies, let's say, on a building's roof. Each next wave is tougher than the previous one. In between you have a little time to eat medkits, collect loot, possibly prepare and activate some traps on zombies' ways to detonate them later, etc. That's not a hard thing to design but potentially you can play such a scenario endlessly, especially if you add some variety in how this develops, what weapons you can choose, etc. Would be awesome to play this in coop. Zombie defense style of game.","Feature requests",1850
"2496","  *A note, to better understand what I'm talking about, there are two locations you can stand that are high up in the game that will help you see what I see. There is a radio tower at the top of the Slums that during the mission Pact With Rais, you climb, and it never becomes a safe house. Standing there will help you see the area I refer to as Harran Business, as you will read. The other place you need to stand is on the highest point of the crane that connects the Tower to the practice tower in the beginning of the game, so you can see the city across the water from the Stadium and all that. Another place to check that sight out is from up top the Infamy Bridge, however I have not done that yet, as I've been writing this post*    Hi guys,so I have a huge list of ideas for the future of Dying Light, probably so many that that's why I chose to make this a separate post. Otherwise I would've just replied to the main post. Also, I'll make a copy of this post and try and put it in the comments section, just in case it might fit.      First and main change I would like to see happen is that, every bit of city as far as thy Crane can see will be released in DLC like The Following. Standing off the far radio tower that is not a safe house, all the way against the opposite side of the map than Old Town, you can see very far, and there is nothing but bigger and bigger city. Imagine 3 bigger and bigger sections of play area than what we will already have when the Following comes out, all released as separate DLC packs that are huge expansions with all new campaign and challenges and any other game modes added to the game as it is, with its ever growing way of playing multiplayer, while there is still so much single player to do as well. This is already the best game on modern consoles in my opinion, just have to get that out there, you guys at Techland have really set a new standard for how video games should be pushed to be made, and I just take in and enjoy every last bit of this game. Whether I just feel like looting, or looking at the sights, Harran is home to me. And like many other players I'm sure, we want to know whats going on in the rest of Harran? Whats in that building at the very other end as far as you can see that looks taller than any other place in all of Harran? Was it meant to be of equal height as Rais's unfinished building in the Slums, like a twin towers thing to mark both sides of Harran? Whats all the history of the rest of the city and whats going on there now? Enough with my opening paragraph, here's my detailed list of ideas based on what I just said above... DLC 1: Harran BusinessAs you stand up here on the radio tower at the edge of the map, looking over the rest of Harran that you currently can't go to, you see there is a middle section of city that is bigger than the Slums and Old Town put together, and it stretches from behind Rais's tower, all the way passed the giant red Antenna on the hill by the water, which I'm 99% sure is the one you climb at the end of the game. Beyond all that is an even bigger city area that looks more or less complete, with a building taller than any other point in all of Harran at the very far back. This is all much easier to see at night from the top of Brecken's Tower, but this will be DLC 2 so we'l come back to that.  For the first DLC Following the Following, it would be this mass stretch just beyond the wall, and it looks like the business part of Harran, probably industrial plants on the far end you can't see well, lots of tall buildings, but also smaller buildings and even Slums that went partly into this business area, so for obvious reasons, I'm going to refer to this area as Harran-Business. The beauty of it, is how its pretty much all cityscape though, as to where The original game is pretty balanced between open space and tightly packed residential areas and bigger city areas, and The Following is going to essentially be all countryside, so it adds a different variety of terrain and how you will move around, depending on how the producers design it, if they take my ideas, and I seriously hope they do. I don't even want credit for it, I just want to play it. My campaign idea for the Business section would be mostly massive amounts of zombies, to change it up from having human enemies. It's further in the future and its all undiscovered to us, so it would make sense. Especially when you look at the layout and begin hypothesizing. I dreamt up that there is a group of several survivors who have taken up two big buildings in the area, the main one being the one kind of straight out in the middle of the left side of the map, its tall and skinnyish and it has two really tall antenna sticks on top of it. The second being a building chosen somewhere further towards the Antenna side of the map. Now these survivor groups are both friendly, and have both been able to contact eachother with small radios, but have never had a good enough engineer to rig something that would sure reach the Slums, and beyond that, the zombies are in much greater numbers and more fierce than those of Old Town. Now to explain how I dreamt they get in contact with Kyle Crane, I need to explain one more detail, so bare with me. When you look to the left (Still on radio tower)  you see three matching buildings in a triangle that are close to the hill side. These three buildings are Volitile nests. Stretching from them, is a single road that is a big stretch of just slum houses that go up to the big bridge that was cut in half for the wall. Volitile Nests should be a new kind of challenge that is harder than the small scale Quarantine Zones, and would be bigger and more puzzle like, similar to Raids on Destiny. I think a total of 6 of these Volitile buidlings in the whole Business area seems about right, but would probably come out in smaller DLC packs thru the year, to keep everyone entertained while the big DLC's come out once a year. Back to the plot, So the whole line of Slums from the 3 tall buidings in the Business area to the bridge, is known as Death Row, because there are so many Volitiles and Virals at night, that they walk the streets like it's Dia de Muertos down the whole road and thru all the slums there, and there's so many that even during the day, in dark places in some of the houses lurk Volitiles that didn't make it back home before sunrise. So because of this, the survivors haven't been able to get anyone close enough to the wall with a radio to contact anyone for help, until a small group takes a recorded radio transmitter device close to the edge where they can find some power, and thats how the DLC would start off, by the Tower or Jaffar picking up this radio signal for urgent help over the wall. So Crane gets there and finds this group in the main building, and as it turns out, there's thousands of survivors, but more than most are too scared and not willing to leave the safety of the two towers they control throughout the Business area, thus making it very hard to survive, and they barely have anyone other than what few surviving runners they have to go out and supply the tower. But this also means that most places you get in and loot will be full of treasure because it hasn't been touched.  You then meet the leader of the main tower and he explains why they have been so far behind, and how they never got air drops in their section, so they've been sitting ducks, leadership is being questioned, acts of cannibalism have been found in the tower causing mass fear among people throughout the buildings. So Crane, Brecken and Spike start setting up Safe zones, training runners, build the bridge over the wall to easily get back and forth between The Slums and Business areas, and the main part of the campaign will be about taking out the three Volitile Towers known as The Bremuda Triangle, as well as the fourth building which is the building right beside the highway on the left side of it, where the highway turns right after have turned left, it has a Crane beside it, which being as he is Kyle Crane, it would be the last mission for the main campaign of the Business, where they get a wrecking ball on the crane and Crane gets to the top and uses the Crane to demolish the building completely, while of course other Volitile nests are blown up or taken down in other creative ways, so it never feels the same. But by completing this campaign, you clear Death Row of being too dangerous to go near and wipe out a mass amount of Zombies, so when the campaign is complete its easier to get around and do other side missions that pop up beacuse there will no longer be streets of volitiles and virals, but of course they'll still be around at night in smaller numbers. Along side that, by teaching these people how to survive, they become permanent allies and start helping more around their tower and training runners as the campaign goes on.  Small DLC packs throughout the year of this 1st DLC could have more Volitile Nests and more game modes and whatever else the creators came up with. I don't want to go too far into detail so that an idea similar to mine might be made and something of this future of Harran I forsee might actually happen. Again, I want no credit for my ideas these are for Techland to look over and decide if they like my idea to push foward and make Dying Light literally the biggest and best game ever made. Complete Last Idea for smaller DLC during the year of Harran Business would be, if you look off the right of the radio tower to where you can see the Antenna area and the lengthy stretch of the Business area, you see one tall building that stands out, it looks like it has big rectangle windows that might be busted out or something, and its a little yellower and lighter than the rest of the buildings down there. That building would be like the Bozak Horde but a Volitile Nest that a crazy guy rigged to send out lots of Volitiles on that side of the map during the night, but also has a way to bring them in during the day, and he has all these radio messages repeating and posters and stuff advertising that its a safe haven, to trick people into going in and being eaten by Volitiles immediately, by his complete torture path of challenges. He keeps claiming that like all serial killers though, he wants to be caught, so if you make it to the top, you can kill him, but Crane plans to bomb the whole building with the new bad guy in the building as well. Just another small DLC idea that gives something else like Bozak Horde.  DLC 1 Overview:*So New modes would be;-Volitile Nests as big challenges, more meant for multiplayer but can be beaten alone as well-Different Layout to conquer-New Plot-Game focuses on gathering and selling to the towers to help them grow and strive, while settling civil disputes and connecting the two towers with the Slums, and main enemies are zombies and not humans-And anything else Techland comes up with Ok, that was pretty lengthy, but DLC 2 and 3 won't be that long, because it's all so far away that I can't really imagine a cool plot like I could by sitting up on this radio tower and looking over the immediate layout that I call Harran-Business. So please keep reading and seriously, please consider these ideas, at least just the concept of being able to go everywhere you see around you. DLC 2: The Big City Again, really all that stands out to me with the big city is that it will be much harder to traverse, it will probably mostly take place actually inside most of the buildings you see rather than out in the streets, giving it much more room for the horror aspect of the game. I also think The Big City should include a bit of being able to forge ways to get around the map. Also the giant building I keep referring to at the other end completely of the whole city of Harran, its like Rais's tower but complete, could maybe be a Tower Crane takes over which also allows you to forge, create businesses, and set up the whole building how you want, and if you want to add floors you have to clear them out first, which would get harder as you go up. So Crane is like King of Harran. Another idea might be to make the whole Big City area an MMO area for Dying Light where it might have all the characteristics except Crane owning the tall tower, and it would be meant to take out huge amounts of all kinds of zombies in different areas, all free roam but still have missions and side missions and what not, and also not needed to be done with a team but will prove almost impossible to beat alone. Really I just want to leave The Big City up to the producers though, especially with how in depth I was with the intro to the rest of Harran, The Business section. So overview of DLC 2 Is The Big City, which for more detail, is the giant part of city you see beyond what I describe as Business, with much taller buildings and a building that I keep talking about that looks higher than any point in all of Harran at the complete opposite side of the whole city. This is all easier to see from the Tower at night rather than the radio tower I'm standing on while writing this (the far radio tower by the wall that is not a base, but you climb it for Karim in Pact With Rais).-Possibly Single Player based campaign area, or the idea of being an MMO area for the game, as one giant lobby where people team up and do missions and invade the whole game as the Night Hunter at night. -Complete different layout to traverse that will be much harder, and probably take place indoors more, and be more of a horror than having fun killing zombies-Basically I just want to be able to go there too, and that really tall tower just catches my eye because there is nothing else that tall in Harran except the mountains that surround it. Okay, so as long as you're still with me, I really hope you all like my ideas and comment your own opinions and make this thread noticed by Techland so they can really look into the idea of spreading out to the entire city of Harran. And maybe even be able to walk to each section or even drive the dune buggy to and in each section of the game as one giant map, but also have fast travel to get there quicker if you don't feel like having to travel so far. Cause by foot, even running, it'd probably literally take 2 hours to go from Old Town to The Big City, again, by foot. Enough, on with the last segment I have... DLC 3: The GRE Strikes Back (Yes That's a Star Wars reference, this game has references to culture all throughout the map already)The last DLC location idea I have, is not able to be seen from the radio tower by Harran Business, you'll need to travel back to the Tower and get on the roof, as I am going to do now... Okay I'm on the roof now.. Actually go up on the crane that takes you over to the ""Practice area"" that you do in the beginning of the game with Rahim, and climb all the way on top of its tallest point where there is a flag you can retrieve. You can also go on top of the Bridge, but I'm already here on the Tower, and I'm too lazy to video game further for details. lol... Now when you look to the right of the Red Antenna area, you see a whole nother section of city, Looks like Old Town, but modern like NYC... Over there, I simply think there should be a huge plot where the GRE and Ministry of Defense have started setting down troops to fortify that city area over there as a giant stronghold, with their own safe zones and their own zombie mutation problems, and all that good zombie stuff. So the rest of the sections of Harran all have to team up, and go to war with the GRE to protect themselves from new plans to level Harran once again, and the whole situation where Crane reached out and stopped it the first time was the last time contact from inside Harran has been heard, and the GRE and MoD have convinced everyone in the world that it was just a conspiracy, but distrust is also at a maximum from the whole world against the GRE and MoD, to where talk of Civil World War is on the brink to take down these two giants that seem to control the world at this time, in this game world. DLC 3 Overview-Completely Plot based to begin the end of Harran's fate against the Ministry of Defense along side the GRE So some of that towards the end might be a bit extreme but I think it would be good story telling to bring an end to the war between Crane and the powers of the world trying to destroy them all, including the virus. DLC 4: Return of the CraneThis would just be part two of the plot against Crane vs the GRE/MoD, and it would take place more in the Slums and Old Town after the rest of the game would have been focused in the rest of Harran since the beginning of the game, but still has focus in the whole map as well, and would end the whole story however Techland chooses, which would hopefully be in Crane's favor. Of course multiplayer and free roam would still be available, along with New Game Plus to restart everything and do it all again on a harder difficulty. DLC 4 Overview-End of story So after 3 hours of writing this, let me make a few personal side notes,-New game modes such as Volitile Nests as Raid like challenges-Access to all of Harran in its entirety-Complete Story-Plot for each section-New weapons-New places-New missions-History of Harran-More clear on how the virus began thru story-More Blueprints-More References***=The Best Game ever made and possibly ever to exist until a real zombie apocalypse happens Clearly I am a huge fan of the game, it is in fact my favorite game, and with how amazing Techland has done, and with how far I think they can push this game with how much potential it has, I don't think they could even go wrong at this point like Destiny did by making Destiny even easier to play. I think that with the right push, hopefully this post being it, Dying Light could be the major turning point in how modern games are made, and instead of sequel games and all, the game just gets bigger instead, with more and more to do, and ever changing with the forums by people like me who love the game. I mean Dying Light really can be the the game that sets a new standard for gaming, with how big it is, how much it has to offer, and how good the graphics are at the same time. Once again, Techland, I, Tyler (Mothm6n66), do not want any credit for any of these ideas. I really want you guys to use them and create something with the ideas I've given. It may seem like I wrote a lot, but this giant idea I had, I just couldn't keep to myself. You guys are awesome, and again, and again, and again... Please give us all of Harran to explore. Along with The Following, you'd have every kind of setting for a zombie apocalypse to take place in, with all kinds of crazy plot for each different DLC which will also have smaller DLC packs with weapons and Game modes like I suggested above. Thanks again, guys, and please, everyone, comment what you think of my ideas, how you might change them, things you might add, I mean Techland listens to this stuff. That's why its taken so long for them to release this DLC, I'm sure.  Finally, I'll see ya'll on the backwoods of Harran Tuesday, in The Following. I literally can't wait... ","Feature requests",1851

"2504","My issue shouldn't even be an issue.  I feel lied to.  They said we would be able to disable the hud.  It's simply not true.  You can disable most of the hud, not all of it.  During the day your game will be hud free.  However, at night you will still see eyeball icons that appear over enemies heads.  These icons warn you that you are about to be spotted while revealing the enemies location.  These icons are very much part of a ""heads up display"".  They are in fact, giving me a heads up while appearing on my display.  I don't know if this is an over-sight, a glitch or just plain laziness on the developer side.  Though I feel obligated to say...  Don't get my hopes up by telling me I can disable the hud if I can't disable all of the hud.  Those icons at night ruin the game in a very fundamental way.   If you play the game on nightmare mode and disable your hud.  You will discover that day time is now more difficult than night time.  Why?  because virals move fast, climb buildings and you get NO WARNINGS!  At night, the most dangerous creature in the game is constantly being labeled before they become a real threat.  I find myself experiencing some relief when the sun goes down because now dangerous enemies are tagged for me.  Even though I really really really don't want them to be.    So I request that you FIX the BROKEN ""disable hud"" option.   Thank you for your time.","Feature requests",1859

"2508","Hello dying light team! First of all, i want to thank you very much for making us such an awesome game, and also the fact that you listen to us! I really enjoy playing dying light, but something i always wished for was a ""hud-option"". And guess what, you gave it!  I only have one complaint about it... i really love playing very immersive, wich in my opinion is playing without the ""hud"". Now because of that i turned the hud option to the option where you hide the hud. Love it. But then, i picked up an item. Huh? No message saying what i picked up... and, now i cannot see my inventory... now i can play without hud but i cannot see wich weapons (+items like bleuprints and materials) i pick up, and wich i choose to use (the inventory menu)... those two things keep me from playing the way i want, totaly immersed. So my question goes;  'Could you maybe bring this option to us in an update? So no onscreen hud like the health bar, level bar at the top-center, equipment bar, etc etc. But then with the inventory slider (option-thingey xp) plus the pick-up info messages.' I hope you awesome people can do something with this, and help out us immersion / no hud freaks haha.  Thanks and cheers, A fan!","Feature requests",1863

It would provide a longer-range distraction than you can get with the firecrackers, which is even more important in The Following, with its wide open spaces and lack of evasion options Secondly and thirdly, a Noisemaker arrow would attract enemies to one spot, which happens to work very well with the electric and explosive arrows.  ","Feature requests",1864
"2510","Recently you have released the 1.07 update for PS4 which includes the ability to turn off film grain (Many thanks!). However, you did not give the ability to turn off motion blur. This is something that bothers me and many other players I assume. I am wondering if it would be possible in a future update? Some of us (myself included) get motion sickness just from the blur when moving around. Being able to turn it off would make our gameplay much more enjoyable.  Also, this may be a little steep for a request but why not give the ability to play at 60 FPS also, as similar with the PC version (which I also have). Players could choose whether to play at 30 or 60. The PS4 is supposed to be next gen it only makes sense to play at 60 despite the alleged 30 being 'better'. I don't think this is true.

Gang patrols (walking and in buggys) and gang hostile safe house fend offs.*Safehouse safety development""madmax 2"". Molotovs thrown by safe house gaurds, flame thrower implacements. *Dune bug*second seat weapon attachments. A rotating torch would be epic to see while driving your bud in a field of zombies. More personal details to dune bugs. *Add a female second protaganist. Let the female gamers who want to run as a female avatar. Possibility is she could be placed into future as side story so that way it would make sense to add her as a second choice to play as. Create bigger scenarios where the GRE or local gangs are doing somethings in areas that are hardly viewed. I noticed there are areas that felt empty.

"2522","(About Survivor Sense highlighting) In the recent update now humans, virals, demolishers, toads, etc along with volatiles and night walkers are all highlighted. (But not goons or biters) by survivor sense, however this makes them hard to tell apart, as the effect obscures their model and is the same for so many zombie types. The enemies being highlighted is now, consistent with the minimap though (this is the good part)Solution: Make highlighted color depend on what type of enemy they are. (This has a lot of cool potential, virals for example could be a blend of both human and zombie colors) . Maybe green for humans and orange for zombies? It would also be great if the return pulse from the survivor sense visual varied in size, and color, depending on the zombie type.Another improvement could be making the visual a bit of a glowing cloud in the shape of the zombie that is rather breif in duration, this would make the return pulse more important, and just make it cooler. (instead of the x ray of the skeleton), it should also be a little more subtle as not to completely cover up the model of the zombie/human (like it does now :/)And the intensity of it could depend on the zombie's power (Volatiles would be almost as intense as they are now, night hunter could stay the same, virals would be a little dim, etc)I'd be so happy if this was put in the game, it would make survivor sense really awesome (instead of it being almost painfully ugly and kind of nonfunctional, and my biggest pet-peve with the game)(About difficulty modes) At max survivor level, normal mode becomes far too easy, but hard mode has the perfect balance of zombie health and power (in my opinion). However, the shops only sell weapons, I don't want to have to scavenge for everything, that just isn't fun. And survivor sense doesn't find loot, that's just painful.The problem: High level players are torn between the game being really easy, or being forced to not be able to purchase things at stores or find loot with survivor sense.Easy Solution:- Hard mode should be renamed survivor mode, and have maybe a few more immersive or hardcore changes made to it, such as a much slower timescale.- New ""hard mode"" shouldn't include the store/survival sense changes.More complex solution:- There could be 3 different dificulty options, for: timescale, scavenging/shop difficulty, and enemy difficulty.- Nightmare difficulty for example, would be one of the options under enemy difficulty, except the longer nights would just be an option under timescale.(This would be like a dream come true, especially if it was in session-options) It would make it so no one is torn between two equally un-enjoyable difficulty modes! The menu could be something like this: Edited February 13, 2016 by VanuCultist","Feature requests",1877
"2523","Safe Houses should be spawn points, PERIOD. If I quit the game, the game should check where I was when I quit. If I was in a valid and active safe house, then that safe house should be set as the position I spawn in at. ALWAYS. 100 PERCENT OF THE TIME. There should never, ever, EVER be a case where if I leave the game when I'm in a safe house that I start out anywhere else. (If I leave from outside the safe house, then well, the game should decide where I spawn based on the active quest.)  It gets bloody ridiculous at times. For example, just now I was on a quest to look for something at the lighthouse. I returned to the gas station outside of town, I was in the safe house and I quit. The light house was on the far side of town. The gas station is the closest safe house. When I loaded the game back up, I spawned in Jamil's farm. As in the quest hub which was FARTHEST from the lighthouse. There is absolutely ZERO excuse for why I should have spawned there and not at the gas station. That forces me to waste a ton of time just getting back to where the h**l I should have been in the first place.No excuse for that at all. All safe houses should be spawn points, and if you leave the game when in a safe house, that same safe house is the only place you should ever spawn in, never anywhere else.","Feature requests",1878

Plus if you keep playing the game and keeping bringing back and selling extra weapons and stuff, you end up having so much stuff that you literally cant run out essentially. Like its more simple in this game than in other games where this is a thing, each weapon depending on its color determines how many times it can be rebuilt, if you like your weapons to last longer you can use upgrades to make them more durable, and you can craft them to have certain power ups to make them more deadly.

"2532","I have an idea for you guys. One I was hoping would be implented a long time ago. I pre-ordered Dying Light, the idea of playing as the zombie thrilled me as not only a gamer, but a zombie lover. The day it was released, I was there at the console at 12:01 AM playing the campaign JUST TO unlock the zombie mode. Once unlocked, I went in as the Night Hunter and handed some players their butts. I am very good at playing the Night Hunter, leveled really fast. As other players progressed, they gained the ability to, craft flares. Now, I understand a human will need some form of protection, especially when playing alone. But let's face it, 99+ flares, several stacks of them at times, and the ability to spam them over the course of the match? Why the Night Hunter stands no chance, ESPECIALLY when there are 4 players doing this. Now, sure, the flare has a cool down, but the cool down takes mere seconds to the Night Hunters spit cool down PLUS, the Night Hunter only has 2 UV protection spits! I'm not saying to decrease the cool down period of the spits, what I would like to see done, put a cap level on those stinking flares. I say what, 5 max per player? If they have 4 players, hey, that's 20 flares. It will add an element of, urgency, to the match, and not scrub it up like some top title first person shooters that are out there. Also, another thing I would like to see done, when the Night Hunter grabs their prey and that prey turns around, again, already within the grasp of their demise, and turns on that UV light, so annoying. If you think about it, the Night Hunter's tendrels are already around the human, how are they able to face the Hunter and beam that magnificent purple light. Kind of unfair, wouldn't you agree? Now, I am certain I will get some hate replies to this, and that is fine. But, when you go into a match as the zombie and the one you are facing off with is throwing flares every 2 seconds, it gets pretty old. Make it balanced please, that is all I ask.

"2535","I created my own topic string about a suggestion for buggy rear view mirrors in The Following here: http://forum.techland.pl/topic/11644-dying-light-following-buggy-rear-view-mirror/ Use the link to comment, but here is what I said:  Dying Light Following Buggy Rear View Mirror  Would most players not want a rear view mirror? It could be a new  three stage novice skill tree path (novice because a rear view mirror seems pretty basic for driving, especially when you have bad things chasing you all the time): simple mirror --> rear mounted spot light (aligned with rear view vision field) --> panoramic mirror wings (these should simply add blind spot vision, by extending the mirror a little on each side with convex mirrors) I will grant you that the front field of view when siting in the buggy is already a little real estate poor, so the size of a centrally mounted rear view mirror near the car level progress bar up top should be carefully considered, and the optional convex mirror wings may not be an option at all, but BASIC MIRROR and NIGHT SPOT LIGHT skill tree options seem like basic options and are painfull (literally and figuratively!) not to have. Very imporant last point, if the convex mirror wings WERE an option, it would be critical that they were add-ons that did not disrupt or change the original basic mirror area.  It would suck if the whole mirror became convex.  The only practical (visually comfortable) way to gain additional angle of view with basically one mirror is to add mini mirrors on a flat mirror's edges.  We've all seen examples of this on non-apocalyptic cars on the roads today, except that they are often tacked right ON the mirror instead of added to the edge (I don't like compromising the original mirror to gain aditional view field). In any event, the development mechanics of convex mirrors, to essentially do the job of side mirrors may be impractical for you guys and I get that.  Just getting a straight rear view that worked in day AND NIGHT would be huge. Thanks, - Enthusiastically counting the days to the beginning......of the end    ","Feature requests",1890
"2536","You guys are amazing. I will be playing any game you put out from now on. When a gamer can appreciate the effort, time and creativity put into a game.... well, let's just say there are very few games coming out nowadays that I can do that with, along with the fact that I continue to enjoy exploring the game after beating mostly everything. One thing I would like to give my opinion on is about pvp. After beating the game I really feel like this is main focus. I won't beat a dead horse about glitching and duplication, but that obviously effects the balancing of pvp. When people can get unlimited amounts of resources and also just get some of the best items traded to them from someone who duplicated it, really takes away from survival aspect and how much time is put into farming these items specifically for pvping with. I guess I did beat that dead horse.Pvp is amazingly fun for me. I really wish there was a separate pvp skill tree specifically for survivors as well as a way to track your progress with pvp ranks. I want to see how much xp I need to get to next rank without being in a match. Also there should be more tangible rewards that people know they are working towards (kind of like the new reputation system in the expansion, cosmetic items to show off ranks, weapon skins) alongside the fact that you get better chances of awesome random loot at the end. There should be separate balancing for pvp. A night hunter shouldn't join one match where the survivor can instantly heal, then join another where the survivor heals over time. Once the match starts, pvp balancing should be the same no matter the difficultly. I would love to see scrolling damage numbers when a player is hit. Different weapons should do different damage based on the weapon type. Correct me if I am wrong, but I equipped a two hander, maxed out that damage tree in the legend skills, and it looked like I was doing the same damage per hit as a one hander would do. If I swing a big chupacabra axe into the night hunter, it should do more damage than a one hander swing. Same applies for gun types and fire rates. Maybe even have higher damage for higher tier weapons (gives incentive for finding these weapons and progressing in pvp). To add to that, if the legend tree was changed to where you could only max out a couple skills, that would bring more balancing to pvp and different player types that want to play different ways. If I wanted to be a big chupacabra sword swinging brute, I would specialize in two hander damage, stamina and health maybe. Or if I wanted to be Legolas, I would be all about agility and speed and obviously bow damage. This brings more to the table for setting up a well-balanced team on co-op to fight the night hunter.More itemization and different skill setups lead to different outcomes and a more exciting PVP experience that makes people want to continue to play. I would love to see professional tournaments for this pvp because it's already is a blast to play and watch.There also really needs to be something in place that gives incentive for people to not leave the match. There's nothing more frustrating than hacking away at the last nest and the night hunter leaves right before you can kill it and survivor gets no rewards. Something like the person that leaves gets no reward or no xp?Lastly I saw that there was a mod or something on the pc version where they had a mode with survivors against other survivors. That really interests me. I hope you guys are planning on bringing that to console as well.I hope one of you gets to read this and agrees with me. These issues might only be important to me, but I know you guys listen to your fans and I am definitely a techland fan now. Thank you for the beautiful game and the time and effort you continue to put into it. SAMBONES! I am a streamer as well.

"2539","Hey Techland! I'd like to start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. I preordered it to get the dockets and ever since it came out I've been obsessed with it. I've played through on Normal difficulty, hard mode, and I'm currently working towards 100%ing the game in Nightmare. And what I really really want to see is two things.To start with, and this is just a small thing, can you guys try to make throwing weapons a bit smoother? As in not glitchy? I really enjoy throwing a massive tribal axe at demolishers and goons, but too many times the weapons seem to glitch out once thrown and disappear under terrain. Sometimes it's okay and I can get them back (through massive amounts of stress and tiny tiny mouse movements) but sometimes I lose them forever which is not good on Nightmare. I can understand blunt weapons bouncing off targets, but going through walls and floors is really frustrating and obviously not a game mechanic.Secondly, can you make varied weapons more viable? I love the knives in this game (largely for their sounds <3), and if possible I will always use them over sickles or katanas. But they are completely useless in a Nightmare run because of their minimal stun. Attacking a zombie with a knife means they can still charge you and attack, whereas with a katana sickle baseball bat or ANY other weapon they will die or be knocked back. I understand the Focus skill can give knives a huge damage buff, but you never get enough attacks in without dying on harder difficulties.Overall though, I absolutely adore this game, and The Following has improved it tenfold. Great work on the expansion and everything that has come with it, you guys are the best!","Feature requests",1894
"2540","I figure the devs must linger in this thread, so I'm going to post this here, too, before I slink off to resume lurking and playing Dying Light... This is not only a suggestion (and begging) in terms of story, but in terms of ideas for new, unique gameplay opportunities as well, both for zombie skill trees (if any) and putting the threat of losing control and mutating worse as an active threat in-game, so that you have to seek out medicine for it in real time while you play the open world. That could add new challenge to the game's higher difficulties.  This was a letter I mailed to Techland. I wish I hadn't abused the word ""incredible"" so much (and I've added a few more notes to the end), but I meant every word and everything I said still stands. I figured I would post it here, too, to try and make sure it gets seen by someone. I'm still really upset by what happened, and I deeply hope they don't leave things this way and they choose to continue the story, at least to end it on a hopeful note (for Kyle and others), more like the original game's ending. I'm looking forward to more Dying Light story content, and I hope it happens.Here's the letter, for anyone interested, with my signature removed:I am a huge fan of Dying Light. I've been a fangirl of Dying Light since before it was released. Roger Craig Smith, one of my very favorite actors, talked to me on Twitter about the game when it was coming out. Him starring in it was what sold me on buying it, but I stayed for everything. Truly, this game knocked me off my feet. I didn't expect such an incredible gameplay experience. Everything about the game captures me. The atmosphere, the gameplay, the art, the music - and, of course, the writing, story, and characters.I immediately fell in love with your protagonist in particular, Kyle Crane. He's so relateable and lovable, he's a wonderful jerk with a heart of gold, and he always says just what I'm thinking. I simply adore his character and, as an aspiring writer myself, his character and his interactions in the story and with the world have inspired me greatly.However, to be frank, I was utterly devastated by the end of The Following. I kind of saw it coming, but I was hoping I was wrong. So, I beseech you: please don't let this be the end of Kyle Crane's story. Please. It isn't Dying Light without Kyle Crane. There's still incredible potential with this story. Playing as Kyle while he's a sentient volatile (even the Night Hunter, you know, so his face doesn't get totally messed up) could be an incredibly unique gaming experience in so many ways, and it could be an incredibly unique story as well.I truly adore every aspect of Dying Light, but the story and the characters (Kyle in particular) is what kept me coming back and what made me play the game in its entirety over four times in a few months (I bought it on two platforms as well, the original game and all the DLC, and I've convinced many friends to buy it as well based on my high praises).So, again, I'm begging you all: please don't let Kyle's story end like this. The ending of the first game was deeply moving to me, especially in a time of my life when I was going through hardships of my own. Somehow, seeing Kyle conquer all odds, watching the ending with hope for a cure, with the hero staying with his friends, the hero defeating the villain - it inspired me. The ending of The Following upset me deeply. I would love, however, to see a happy ending still come from this. Kyle has a chance to redeem himself, even if his form is mutated. There's still hope for a cure. He can control himself, like the Mother could, and thus he has potential to still help people and fight for his friends. Even, later in the story, he could find a cure and become himself again, instead of having to stereotypically sacrifice himself or devolve into a monster. Endings like those are becoming increasingly overdone, and Dying Light has the chance to be unique (again; it already has before).I know this thing has gotten very lengthy, and for that I apologize. I cannot deny the incredible passion I feel for Dying Light, its setting, its story, and all its aspects. I want more Kyle Crane in my life. I want to see is story end well for him. I want to see his incredible struggle, be with him every step of the way, guide him through more of your incredible stories in this incredible world. I love Dying Light. It's one of my favorite games of all time (and I've been a gamer all my life). It's left a lifelong impression on me as a gamer and as someone who wants to become a storyteller someday. Dying Light is a beautiful experience. It's more than just a game.I sincerely hope that, in the future, you consider continuing to let us play as Kyle and tell more stories from his point of view. He's a wonderful character and, to me, this amazing setting would never be the same if we didn't play as him the entire time.I could continue to sing the praises of Dying Light and prostrate myself before you to beg for mercy for Kyle (and to beg to let us all continue playing as him). I truly feel that his story is not over, nor does it have to be over. I look forward to all the stories left with this protagonist and this setting in this beautiful game.The way I see it, there are multiple possibilities for handling what happened to Kyle in the ending where he didn't just sacrifice himself...He could be a sentient zombie, like a Night Hunter (or a volatile but hopefully without those mandibles). He could be slowly mutating more and gain more abilities over time, but he isn't completely inhuman, and he's still largely in control of himself. Maybe he's still slowly mutating more, so it gives a reason to still have the zombie seizures and keep the antizin and stuff (since I loved that element, personally), and still keep that desperation. However, since the Mother never mutated to a point where she lost her intelligence, it makes sense that Kyle wouldn't, either.The whole thing could've been one giant hallucination. That one would be pretty easy to explain, because - frankly - I initially thought it was. I still really hope it was. Did the Mother even really force enough of the liquid down his throat for it to matter? It sure didn't look like much. Why would he change so fast? Why would he change at all, with that small amount? He certainly doesn't have to. It could've been a hallucination. But maybe, since he did get a small amount of the liquid in his system, he could be mutating faster now. Has more zombie seizures, gives an even more desperate reason to find more antizin and other ways to stave the virus off, etc. But he'd still be human, and under that same threat (I love the zombie seizures in the original game, I'd hate to see them leave).There are other different ways it could be handled, but I would really hate for this to be the end of Kyle Crane's story. Techland had something truly great going with Dying Light and with Kyle Crane. I hope they don't end it in this way and they choose to pursue unique paths to a more unique (and happy, preferably involving Kyle getting cured or at least left alive and hopeful and searching for a way, like the struggle to maintain antizin while trying to find a cure in the end of the original game, which I thought was a wonderful ending). No matter how they choose to continue Kyle's story, if they do, it'd become a unique experience in multiple ways. I already find Dying Light unique, but they've opened up even more interesting and unusual paths to explore - things gaming hasn't done before. They could break new ground in the zombie genre.I need more Dying Light in my life - and it isn't Dying Light unless we get to play as Kyle Crane.","Feature requests",1895
"2541","I would like to suggest two inventory system modifications:When making a new item with a blueprint, it would be nice to know how many items of that blueprint already exist in inventory; and show that on the blueprint screen.  Currently I have to go to inventory, right down a number, go to the blueprint screen, and count until I have enough.  It's annoying when I go over and use up an extra inventory slot for 2 extra stars I shouldn't have made.  For example, Throwing Stars.  If it says I have 52 stars, and I can 5 at a time, I'd like to be able to see that when I craft 5 more, I see 57 items in my list.When making items with a blueprint, I would like to be able to specify how many to make.  For example, medkits ... I want to make a medkit 12 times (for a total of 24).  It's really unfun to have to sit there hitting enter twice for every medkit I make.  I want to be able to set it to 15, then go grab a coffee beer while it crafts.Thanks,ElEdited February 19, 2016 by Elenesski","Feature requests",1896

"2543","I've played this game quite extensively (nearly 200 hours) and I enjoyed it all quite thoroughly. In my time playing this game I have come up with a lot of suggestions and feature requests.  I personally want to see more parkour abilities added to the base game.  I would love to see a large downtown area with plenty of parkour opportunities and wider streets that we could use our vehicles in. There's that large area you can see that is neither the slums nor old town in the distance which I believe is a downtown. Use it! Perhaps a prequel DLC? I wish that the endings for The Following would have shown more about what happened after you make your decision. If there is another big story DLC, please make the finale multiplayer. As my friend and I climbed the lighthouse we hoped that we wouldn't have to play separate finales again. We were quite disappointed. More advanced combat would be nice with weapon blocking, ducking, etc. Hand to hand combat with first person counter attacks would be cool. Perhaps a disarm move for enemies wielding weapons? A system similar to how Faith in Mirror's Edge Catalyst is hit by less bullets when she is freerunning would be helpful in those gun sequences. Speaking of gun sequences, more! The fight at the granary was a blast! I think the stealth sections were great (the office and radio tower being prime examples.) Could it be expanded on to add silent running and walking, silenced guns, more kinds of silent takedowns (jump down and stab?) Fast travel between safezones (only from another safezone) would make the game much more playable. Redo the grappling hook so that it can be used to swing between designated points in the environment and so it acts as more of a throwable ladder that you actually have to climb instead of just being a flight mechanic. Integrate an actual cover system perhaps with snap to cover and move from cover to cover functionality. A more precise rifle with a scope. A quick weapon pickup and equip that you can use in an instant and then drop by hitting a certain key or running away. The feature I'm talking about is shown in the Run Boy Run trailer when Brecken is running and quickly picks up the weapon nearest to strike and then drops it right after to sprint away. More immersive animations (getting into the car, picking things up, etc.) Further upgrade the speed of the car (Nitro III?) The small sections with parkour opportunities should be more optimized (the granary in particular.) Buggies should be able to destroy more objects (especially with the ramming bar upgrades) such as smaller rocks and trees. I got stuck in an area with some little benches and it was really hard to get out. Maybe overkill, but gun upgrades to the car?  A car backseat operable missile launcher?Edited February 19, 2016 by minestein","Feature requests",1898

"2547","Techland was chosen a weirdest way to make dlc for the game, really guys. I reeeeeeeallyyyyy wanna to hear, what a reasoning was behide choice to make car-based dlc with almost no buildings in it. Seriously, please explain. Because let's ask - what the key points in DL gameplay? Answer - it is melee combat and climbing. So whats can be better dlc if not something with no buildings to climb, and no new melee skills? BUT - with car and ranger weapon? Following is like complete opposite to what, that makes DL so great. LOL. That why it's kind of weird dlc. So, on that note - Please add more. 1. Melee skills and combos. Like for example if tap two times ""left"" and then attack character will do quick long reach stab. Of two time back and then both mouse buttons - will make character ACTUALLY BLOCK all income melee attack with weapon, or parry. In one phrase - please more useful combat skills with melee weapons. Not just random swings, like it is right now but actually skills and combinations. Maybe some kind of counter attacks. 2. If possible - more very big and hight structures to climb up to. In ideal - at least ""some portion"" (maybe isolated location to which player teleported) of big city with tall skyscapes. 3. Elite shops with hight prices but which always has all resources needed for crafting. Right now it just makes no sense - when character has 300000+ dollars, but still must find ropes by himself. Aslo please fix nightmare and hardmode. Again it looks like it was untested or something, But those modes actually makes game a lot easier, because of how much exp they giving. Right now just by jumping from building to building at night while moving from one edge of the map to another edge- alarming all zobies and their cats - running away form them easily because of firecrackers - is giving 20000 exp at average by night. So now, it actually is very rewardable with almost no risk - even if just killing zombies near safe spaces. How exactly that is making game harder, if character survive skill which opening better weapons in stores is bumping up to 15-20 just for couple of night of questing?

Could you possibly add in more special Infected?  I love the current mutations we have now, the Bomber being my favorite because of all the times he surprised attack me, and I fatally swiped my weapon at him.  Now I don't have many ideas, sense you guys hit a lot of the things that make special zombies, Special.  But after some thinking I came up with the idea of Rotten Mutts.  These are of course, Dogs that have been infected with the virus, and know roam the alley ways and train yards of the Slums, the Streets of Old Town and even the tall grassy fields of the Country side.  I do know that your awesome Story introduced all of the special infected, but maybe the Dogs could be introduced in a quest about strange howling heard in the sewers, and when Kyle Crane goes to investigate BAM he finds the sewer completely full with zombified Dogs, and after a intense chase scene where Kyle must escape a pack, he climbs up to Harran, hoping that will be the last time he sees the rabid animals ever again.  But of course, they find a way to get into the streets, and a new quest line opens to stop where ever they come from, and then after that, the Dogs can spawn randomly in the world to attack players not on rooftops or anywhere high.  Of course these dogs will need a attack other then scaring the **** out of unsuspecting players.  Sense these are wild zombie dogs, their best and most feared attack would be grappling onto Kyle's arm with their razor sharp teeth and tearing his arm up, causing quick burst of damage, if the action buttons is not tapped repeatedly to punch the mutt off.  Other attacks could consist of clawing the player, and taking small bites at the player.  And for the last terrifying detail of this abomination that I have though of, the Dog would be extremely fast, faster then the common Viral and maybe even faster then the Night time Zombies. Of course, for balance issues, the dog damage might be reduced even lower then a viral, but the main purpose is for it to distract the player while other infected attack, that is why the Rotten mutt might be found in hordes of zombies, grappling onto Kyle when he least suspects it and allowing Biters and Virals to get in a few hits before Kyle punches off and most likely kills the mutt.  As my final idea, these dogs, should not have a large amount of health, their health should be close to a biter or a viral, maybe somewhere in between. Sorry for the huge idea, got really excited with the idea of the Rotten Mutt, and of course, couldn't help but go on and on about it above, well here is idea Number 2. 2. Now I said this in my last post, but could you add some weapon mods?  I know they could tip the way Gameplay flows, especially with Silencers stopping virals from hearing shots, but of course, the Silencer could only go for Pistols, and scopes and sights could go for rifles and Pistols, while grips and recoil mods could go on Shotguns.  And what I think a lot of players want, extended mags.  Just please think it through before ditching the idea, I know this might be kind of stealing what Fallout 4 has implanted, but I assure you a lot of players love the idea of firearms getting their own mods, making gun gameplay possibly more enjoyable for the gun crazy side of the Dying Light community. whew, that was shorter then expected. ON TO NUMBER 3! 3. Last but not least, I think airdrops need to become more important, they are very important in the beginning of the game, but as players level up, and reach max survivor level, and max Legend level, the packs become ultimately useless.  Maybe add a feature where turning a certain amount in can have the quartermaster give the player a really good weapon, and the more you turned in, the better the reward you got, and the reward could vary from a awesome weapon, to a chupacabra ton of random supplies and crafting materials.  Or even MONEY!!!!!!

"2567","I've not yet played The Following yet, but I have had a solid shake at the Enhanced updates to the game. Some things I think should be added to an already fantastic formula. - You guys added greater variety of guns, but the ability to add upgrades to them or modify them in any way would be awesome. - The ability to fire your gun while sliding or looking back would be pretty cool, even if it would totally against the idea of staying quiet. - The grappling hook really ought to function like an actual grappling hook. You should be swinging down to hang below it, not going all Just Cause on the game. - Greater customisation options for outfitting your runner. Failing that, more style in any future outfits. Trench coats, anyone? - THE CAPACITY TO HAVE A FEMALE KYLE CRANE. Name her Kara, or something. All the dialogue would be the same, except for the name, and the gender of the players voice. Hell, you could go a little bit further and swap Rahim and Jade in the story depending on the gender you chose. These things are MEGA UNLIKELY to happen, but I think greater customisation in almost any form is a thing that players are after, so there's my five cents.","Feature requests",1922
"2568","Please!  Bring back the UV light button..   AND the field of depth adjustment bar..   I'm going crazy without my uv light button...

Also helping a lot with long range uv and short range. it enables less confusing and ""button stumble"" while trying to swing a weapon and simultaneously shine uv.  And the field of depth the game is currently locked into...  It's making me go crossed eyed,  I originally had the setting turned up to max... And now it seems to be locked into default, which is far from my preference. Why? Why would you have the button layout a certain way for soo long and then randomly remove several options and settings?? I could see adding options, but to just simply remove??? What the hell?

That may sound silly, but I feel like it would really add to the dire situations that the zombie apocalypse would cause.     Right now, once you have captured a safe house, it's ALWAYS safe, which can take away a lot of the intensity of the game. I was thinking of sometimes having safe houses require some task for them to be functional every once in a while, like more materials to power UV lights or having more of an incentive to pick up airdrops. I'm not sure how you could prevent these tasks from being annoying and repetitive, but it would great if you guys found a way! ^^ Also, I would really appreciate it if you added a way to skip quests after completing the game, without starting a new one. EDIT: It would also be very helpful if you had an option to show the equipment/throwable select menu when the HUD is disabled!Edited February 26, 2016 by Digital Oddity","Feature requests",1929

"2576","Hello Techland,I would like to suggest adding more rare blueprints with strong single effects as well (Impact, Freeze, Electric). I saw that Fire, Bleed and Toxic were already in place. (Thank You so much for that)Also, Is there a way you can increase a drop rate for Gold tier weapons? At least in hard mode?I've been looting very hard crates and vans, doing quarantines, killing demolishes, volatiles etc... since the gold tier and hard more were first introduced in the game.All I got was 1 gold sledgehammer and I have not found anything else besides this sledgehammer, given that I was doing that for almost a year and played nearly 300 hours - it is very abysmal and ridiculous drop rate which reduces motivation to keep playing.I heard the drop rate was increased In one of the earlier patches, but how come I still do not get any gold weapons playing on hard mode?1 Gold Weapon after looting around for nearly 1 Year? Seriously?Gold weapon reward probability rate during invasions should also be increased as many of night hunters are maxed out by now, or nearly maxed out in their rank. For fairly new survivor players it is really hard to win many games in a row with such hunters, especially going solo.I would greatly appreciate if these things get addressed in future patches.Thank You as always!-xPauler","Feature requests",1931

"2578","Got some suggestions for BTZ mode.As we all know btz mode is only one mode with human's destroying nests and NH kills human's 10 times. I mean dont get me wrong its cool but get's abit repetative. Why not add some new sub mode for BTZ? Like for example simmilar to Left 4 Dead: Match with more human's and max 4 hunter's or 1 hunter and 3 other different special infected from the game like evolved volatiles and evolved toads with increased health or something, Enhanced Demolisher should be equal as a Tank from Left 4 Dead which is player controlable.So anyways Demolisher is the most powerful of them but all these player controlled infected are weak to UV light. In this mode all infected have their special abilities: Evolved Toads can spit all spit's as NH and also can use his toungue like a smoker from L4D to pull victims back, also this subtype of toad regenerates faster his toxic spit than NH but slower than NH other spit's, Toads only escape mechanism is his speed and agility which can leap far distances and scream which can summon normal infected to aid him (like a screamer), has weakest claw attack - 125 HP - 1-2 hits with any weapon. - max spawn 1 Evolved Volatile is simmilar to NH but with less skills, all his skills are the same as new volatiles from the following. Basically its stronger than normal volatile. HP 300 - 4-5 hits - can spawn max of two  Evolved Demonlisher is a special infected which spawns only if Infected team is losing of if a player on infected side has most kills or damage inflicted to human's. Demolisher has the same abilities as normal demolisher from the game but with one new skill. His scream ""MMB"" stuns all players around him and can summon viral's to his aid.  To kill it players will need to remove his armor like in the normal game to start to inflict damage, after that Demolisher dies by at least 10-12 hits - 1200-1500 HP MaxNight Hunter will stay the same because this is most powerful special infected that can only be spawned once in a match.  Basically infected side should kill human's which try to finish certain tasks to win this mode, gather resources to build/repair safe zones and battle along the way the infected, the human side wins when they enter the safe zone, 1 human minimum.Basically this idea of a mode for BTZ is the same as Versus of Left 4 Dead, since Dying Light has very simmilar or the same features lke good old L4D i dont see a reason why Techland should think this idea through and modify it to their own taste.","Feature requests",1933

"2580","Hi all, personally I think Dying Light 2 would work well in a built up city, say four times as big a map as the original. Plenty of Parkour opportunites, plenty of places to hide / scavenge / find hidden loot. The real horror of Dying Light, was the human stories, the emergency broadcasts, the 'please save us' signs, the abandoned cars on the freeway. For me, the growing list of 'freaks' is getting a bit silly. They aren't needed. An infected apocalypse is horror enough. The film 28 days later, 28 weeks later - that's horror. We don't need the toads everywhere or giant demolishers. Note, Call of Duty was it it's best playing with single-bolt rifles and AK47's - now we have laser-beams and running up walls. We need a great story. We need a chance at the end to make it out of the map, if - we've done the right things along the way. We want choice that can come back and bite us hours later. Fallout 4 has lost the 'karma' perks to it's detriment. We don't need 200 crafting perks, as they are all basically 'electric shock' 'more power' 'flame'. Looking through my kit bag, I had twenty orange/gold weapons and more stuff than I could scroll down on than I needed. I had over one million three hundred thousand dollars...I had shotguns and revolvers that I'd never used...and strangely, a police rifle with more power than a military one..?I'd like to see more scenes in offices, hospitals, barracks, public places as fighting the humans was just as fun as cutting through zombies. The climbing was good, the detail was really good. Bombers would blow up a mile away, but suddenly, I'd have 8 volotiles under my feet...not good. Not hard, even on nightmare, just annoying. I didn't make that noise to trigger them....and I was a mile away. I personally don't mind either ending of The Following as Crane had become a serial killer anyway. The game didn't allow you to make much (if any) choices to spare humans; humans that just might be of use to you hours later...or to come back and challenge you again. Gamers need choice and great stories. Please don't dumb down Dying Light. You have a great starter game, well done.","Feature requests",1935

"2583","Ok I will start this post saying I love and Hate this game...........I love doing the missions and Building my character up.  I hate when another player attacks you as a Night Hunter and when you have him beat he quits on the last volitile spawn.  This is a very annoying problem.  And tonight I have had enough.  I have played all day long doing little side quests and have been attacked atleast 6 or 7 times today and everyone of them quits at the end because you are going to win.  I started doing the mission (sorry forgot the name of it)  where you have to climb the bridge towers and unscrew the UV light bulbs.  It took forever to figure out how to get to the top of the towers when a night hunter comes in.  (not a big deal right?)  So I fight this night hunter all the way back down the towers and across the map to the volitile spawn.  (which was no easy feat to get to the spawn from the tower)  I finally get to the last volitile and start killing it and he quits.  So for the time I fought him I got nothing.  I wasted a bunch of med kits, the wear and tear on my weapons and a wasted a bunch of UV Flares.  How is this fair?  You need to fix it that if they quit then you win and get compensated for it.  I was sooooo pissed because going up the tower and back down was no easy task much less fighting a Night Hunter while doing it. Sorry it so long but I think the developers need to see what people go through in these Be the Zombie missions. Rant over","Feature requests",1938
"2584","I just wanted to say I really enjoy playing dying light on ps4 and I bought the season pass and have love what you guys put out so far on all the dlcs.the following sofar as of this point I'm 90% and I like cruising around in the buggy. It's a nice change up from all the jumping around. But one thing I've noticed that I had a bit of trouble with is lockpicking. I like that you can be able to pick the locks on a lot of different things but one thing is I spend a bit of time trying to find the sweet spot in the locks. It gets a bit frustrating especially with the master and harder locks. I like playing another game that you can pick locks in and they got armor and a perk that helps boost finding that sweet spot. Just as a idea why not supplement the type of thing in the game some how? If not by weapon or clothing or even by the add on for weapons upgrades like the king and enforcer. I just thought I'd run it past here and hope it's a good idea that you'll use. Thank you for the hard work you guys put towards the making of the game. Keep up the great work.

"2586","*SPOILERS FOR THE FOLLOWING*   Techland, I beg of you to keep Crane as the main and playable character for future DLC's or games. If we are to believe that the ""Volakyle"" ending for the Following is canon, (which I am 99% sure it is), then I think his story shouldn't have to end. Like I said in a previous post of mine, just add some new mechanics for the night phase when playing as Crane, such as going insane due to being a volatile, and perhaps add a new volatile based skill tree. Instead of having safe houses for the player to take refuge in, have Volatile nests/caves, or other mechanics such as that. Techland, you gave us a perfect character with this game, and I hope you don't take him away from us right away. I think you can continue his story, despite him becoming a volatile.  In short: Find a way to keep Crane playable for future content, and add some new mechanics to go along with his new nature.

I am with the minority group of gamers who suffer motion sickness and discomfort from the motion blur and low field of view. It will be greatly appreciated if you would add the option to disable motion blur, and a field of view slider. I know the crosshair is supposed to ""ease motion sickness"" but it doesn't work. The field of view is so low it makes me highly uncomfortable. So a field of view slider and an option to disable motion blur should make some of us comfortable, and feel less ill.

"2591","Can you guys please add an option to disable auto-aim or aim assist with throwing weapons and the bow?  Have them go right to the middle of the screen like the guns do. I've noticed at certain angles it's actually impossible to hit the infected with the bow. A zombie will be in a certain pose, and the auto-aim will ""correct"" the shot so that it misses. The best example of this: when you meet a survivor struggling with an infected that is biting/trying to bite them, trying to hit them with the bow from a distace and from the side is completely impossible! I drew the situation since I didn't have any screenshots and I'm not sure how long it would take to come across this situation This is NOT the only situation the auto-aim is a problem. When you're far away or there is a large height difference between you and the target, the bow simply aims for the center of mass, no matter where you point it. This makes headshots impossible anywhere but close range, even for a skilled player who practiced with the bow.

"2593","first i want to say that dying light is my favorite game in my library and it has the most chance of beating my tf2 hours and i had a few suggestions for the game 1.a sword that defeats the fabulous wrench in damage because honestly a sword should do a lot of damage 2.night hunter secondary objectives,this could force the players to either split up or have them defend more areas and if the night hunter would complete it volatiles will spawn during the invasion (let the night hunter pound manholes maybe?) 3.i had an idea for a character that functions as a merchant but only sells weapons she owns a small shop in old town near the hospital and she offers a few quests that offer new weapons for the player to use (i thought of her to be insane but co-operative she refers to herself as 'we' and uses alot of methaphores) 4.one of her missions feature a shipment of weapons that sunk before the outbreak and she wants you to dive it up the mission is rewarded with a sniper rifle of some sort (stats are 100 damage,max acuracy,clip is 5 and firerate is about as fast as the bows reloading that is with the legend system excluded) 5.in another one of her missions she wants you to bring her 20 cosmetics because she says camo guns sell better and this mission is rewarded with a premium smoke bomb blueprint 6.in the last one she wants you to bring her 5 military rifles,5 german pistols and 5 double barreled shotguns.this quest is rewarded with gas grenades (gas grenades shroud an area in gas that causes moderate poison to enemies for a short time) 7.an independant fatigue system that can be turned on or off individualy it features movement speed debuffs if the player does not sleep for a period of time","Feature requests",1948

"2595","3:52 PM 3/2/2016 I just started The Following on PC (nightmare).  The map is bigger than what I thought.  Right now Im just messing around trying to get familiar with the map and the new stuff in the game like driving.  I just wanted you guys to know at Techland its so obvious in the game.  No Im not in tears Im doing okay but do these others around me know?  I don't know what happened back in Smallville KS. If you guys want ideas keep the story going and adding onto Harran with DLC.  You know how you can switch between Sector 0 and the Slums?  Do you guys plan on making something like that with The Following or is it too late because of the new features like the buggy?  It would be nice to go back and forth between the countryside and Harran.  Just keep adding onto the map and don't stop with the story. I want to see a DLC where soldiers who are on your side at the beginning but then turn against you later on and are attacking the zombies too but get overrun by the infected and virals.  You end up fighting off soldiers more than zombies and try to use zombies to fight off soldiers.  Like at a giant military installation.  What do I wear for a uniform?  Remember the original Resident Evil game when it first came out?  Chris Redfield had an alternate uniform that was blue and black at the sametime Im H.U.N.K.  Buying this DLC you get access to a new uniform from the military installation.  Add in the weak pistol that has unlimited ammo to it.  Does 200 dmg max per a bullet.  That's fair game?  Thinking of the scene from RE Apocalypse downtown being invaded by zombies in the streets and alleys laying rounds down range but the dead kept coming at them. I use a custom Five Seven pistol. You should make Excalibur from original Dying Light story have unlimited damage (never breaks and never need to repair it) but make it weak.  Is there a weapon like that in game?Edited March 3, 2016 by Cpt.

"2602","Before i share my ideas, i would like to thank u Techland for giving us such a wonderful game, its truly a mindblowing game. It has no restriction in the game and we could do whatever we wanted to. Looking foward for Dying light 2. Now heres the ideas :   More night zombies mutations  When the alarm snooze, the first thing that came into every players mind will surely be Volatiles. Ya, the volatiles are are truly some cool mutation. As players get more powerful, volatile became less challenging but the blue one is still pain in the a**. Good work for adding in the blue mutation . Hope to see some new mutations as powerful as the volatile and making them rivals .  Storyline : The current storyline is certainly fun and challenging . But its lacking of good narratives . Im sure techland can do better .  Classes : Dying light has lots of different weapon variation, so of course there are different type of players in this survival game . Some may choose to run , some may choose to shoot , some may choose to assasinate , some even may choose to cut . Maybe in the future, players may have the chance to progress in different path which differ them from other players . It would be intresting some type of weaopons are only available for certein class of players as players reach a higher level in the game.   Safehouse : A Prison, certainly the best place to stay away from zombie . Hope to see it in the future titles . It would be great if players could customize their safehouse , choosing NPC to be placed in a particular safehouse . Add more ways to unclock a safehouse, make it more challenging . In the game, i always hope to build the safehouse i wanted too . Sometimes when i enter a building or a house, i'll be thinking how awesoem it would be if i can turn this into a safehouse  More details in weapon crafting  Collecting materials throughout the map and craft our one of a kind weapon . I would love to see guns modifications too. Edited March 7, 2016 by Binny","Feature requests",1957

"2608","First of all - thanks for this game. One of the best games i have played, i am really proud that Poland has such a good products. Many bugs, errors and shortcomings, but still this game gives me a lot fun and is very playable. Anyway i understand this. I prefer to play games like this one, many of AAA productions from West, are just next games from factory band, without heart. Thank You. My proposals - I agree with Uncle Ship about Sniper Rifle, it can be fun . Shame is that there is no option to see/examine complete 3d model of our weapons and ourselves with costume. But the most important and most annoying thing for me in this game is how saves works. Beside autosave i have possibility to save progress through going sleep, but - exp and items are saved but not place of spawn, it is related to actual quest. For me this is not good solution for game with big open world. When i die - its ok, but for example - if i want to do something other and i run though whole city, go sleep there and turn off the game, when i back - my spawn is on other side of the map according to quest, this is really annoying.","Feature requests",1963
"2609","Hello Techland, first of all I enjoy your game a lot... except btz but still I love everything else no matter how hard you have made it to play, loved the challenge, I hope you see and take my requests for consideration for a maybe next patch, and excuse my gramma since its not my native language. Buggy customization:I don't know if it exist already but where are the classic dices? ok maybe they could be dice with skulls or just skulls but there is a lot of paint jobs and few decorations, Rais's hand would be awesome too, NH bubblehead, Mother bubblehead, there is a big room for ideas. A motor boat and casual treasures on the sea:It would be cool to dive into the sea and be able to loot on an aquatic enviroment, it would be of good use for all that space, the boat could be unlockeable on a mission. Fast swim passive skill:I think this skill could be of good use for sea weed looters like myself, it could be given by a survivor o learned from a book, this is an alternative if the boat its to much. LockPick book:A skill learned by reading or mission, that makes 5% easier to unlock hard locks. Increase the chances to find a bitter inside a closet, this happen to me just like 2 times and was pretty cool when happened I think it would add some jump scares especially on nightmare mode. I may sound crazy and im almost jocking but what about a casual eclipse randomly that makes virals go out for like 5 minutes?, it would be cool to watch and could make things fresh, unaware players be like ""wuaaaaat?"" only on nightmare mode of course. and finally be able to make silencers, that last one clip, it could be made with plastic material. And thats all I hope you liked my ideas keep the good work techland!.Edited March 10, 2016 by FaustoFimbres","Feature requests",1964

The level of technical and artistic skill your team has demonstrated is inspiring. Ok... Now that my gushing is out of the way... Here is my idea. With The Following being released I would love the ability to loot Fuel and Car Parts off of the cars in the core game of Harran. I do not know how Dying Light was constructed and would hope it would be as easy as replacing the asset in the database with the new versions of the vehicles that contain the fuel and hood searchable compartments. I understand that this request would be prohibitively complicated (and therefore expensive) if each car had to be removed from the game and replaced with a new model.   It would, however, advertise The Following to those who do not have the expansion. They would pick up the parts and any time they pick up a new part they have not found before they get a message ""This part is for use in The Following expansion"" or something to that effect. ","Feature requests",1973

I have millions of ""things"" and never ever want for anything. I've never built a flare, or a medkit. Found too many in drops. Make it REALLY scrounging, like spamming flares in an emergency really uses up a key asset. That would make it harder (less bullets, less flares, less explosives - but make explosives a bit more deadly to the zombies. I'd rather have one explosive that can kill everything it hits than 10 that take 1/10 their hitpoints) just give us less stuff. Should be all mellee with the occasional bullet or explosive when needed against big guys and flares and medkits hard to come by (at least in nightmare)","Feature requests",1979
"2625","almost a perfect zombie game, but there are some things which i miss: ZOMBIES:- i miss military and swat zombies, i mean there are plenty of police cars on the streets but barely police zombies. Also, since this game plays in turkey, i miss some zombies wearing islamic clothes, for womens hijab/niqab, and for mens jubbah for example. ENVIRONMENT:- Ive noticed, that there arent any military vehicles on the street. In the storyline, the military is active but outside harran city. In such a situation, the police wouldnt be active alone, military would be there too. Some humvees, tanks, troops transporters etc would be nice (ofcourse not drivable).- Another thing is, the repeat of current vehicles on the streets, i would love to see more different vehicle models with different variants (for example, a BMW like vehicle in black, blue etc color). WEAPONS:- I know that this game is more a melee fighting game than a shooter game, but more weapons would be good. A huge arsenal doesnt mean that you will get much easier to firearms. they just need to be rare or placed in a good hide.- Also, upgrades and attachements (dotsight, reflex sight, flashlights and laser sights etc) for firearms would be nice. ITEMS- it would be good if the flashlight is a item you have to select from your inventory that is also holding on your hands. I mean not a invisible flashlight you carry everytime everywhere, but like here: http://cdn.mmos.com/wp-content/gallery/no-more-room-in-hell-overview/no-more-room-in-hell-flashlight.jpg This would also give flashlight attachement of weapons a sense, when you hold a rifle, you cant hold a flashlight at the same time. For pistol, you could do it like in no more room in hell: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-atWkCAJtWb8/TuveuHN1f7I/AAAAAAAAAv4/8EiOnzTu3Ww/s1600/NoMoreRoomInHell3.jpg when holding a pistol and you press the flashlight button, he start to hold the flashlight with the second hand, maybe would makes the pistol inaccurate then. - Since this game has night, a nightvision would be helpful. GAMEPLAY:- Adding a hunger and thirst system would be great.- I miss the alcohol drinking like in dead island. overall, i am happy with dying light.

"2626","Well first thing I'd enjoy seeing is quite a few things which I have made a list of.1) The repair counter, good idea but not so in the long run. I think I'd enjoy seeing someone in the game that could repair broken items for money/ resources. Because what the player does is Jury rig the weapons. it legs them last longer but it isnt a repair. 2) changes to the challenges, no one in their right mind would agree to them especially with a time limit it kind of trivialises the zombies instead, running challenges should be about getting supplies to safe houses quickly, killing challenges it states you need to teach people how to fight so why can't you set up this camera and doc some moves  in front of it while staying above a certain health level.3) Another isn't much of a change but I'd like to see some fighting styles Katana style, some martial arts.

"2628","Whilst playing dying light the following, I encountered a crossbow and instantly thought of an idea for a second, large scale DLC.-StoryThe DLC would be called The Hunted and is about a large food shortage in The Tower. It takes place 3 years after the outbreak and is a completely different timeline than The Following. Crane finds a map while looking for food that leads to a way out of Harran. The map says scribbled across the top, The Grounds. He tells Lina that he will find this strange ""Grounds"" place and sets out on discovering it. He arrives via sewer, similar to The Following, but crawls out of an abandoned volatile nest to a large Forest. Crane finds an old man in a small log cabin named Jafir. Jafir is at his deathbed when crane finds him and the tells crane to take care of his 'zone' and not to let Cysiar have it. He dies as he hands Crane his rifle. Crane learns that the surrounding hunters are Cysiar's food suppliers, including Jafir, but Jafir didn't want to serve Cysiar because he was a warlord 3 times more powerful than Rais ever was. Cysair forces Crane to hunt and sell him the meat for basically nothing in return. Techland, I'll leave you up to the twist.-Game Play Aspects.The character is introduced to wildlife and *more* herbs.The character is introduced to weapon modifications..The character is introduced to tree parkour..The character is introduced to new firearms and the new skill tree of Hunting..The character is introduced to 'zones' which are specific areas of which hunter will hunt for food..The character will have to take into account the population of wildlife and zombies in Jafir's zone..If the character runs out of wildlife they will have to resort to poaching, which can get the character targeted by the zone owner..If the character's zombie population is to large (fences being broken; gates falling down) they will begin to infect the wildlife and cause Zombails (zombie animals). If the character hunts the Zombails and sells the meat to Cysiar or other hunters, they may get targeted by Cysiar or hunters, if the hunters don't die first..If the character murders/poisons a hunter, they can steal there zone and hunt off it without worry of being targeted. This makes you gain more income for repairs and upgrades to the zone, and weapons for fighting zombie attacks and for scavenging abandoned log houses..The Hunting skill tree allows for the ability to slow time when aiming, create modifications for weapons,  increase accuracy and precision, access to more modifications based around the new herbs, and improvements to tree parkour.   ","Feature requests",1983
"2629","I see a lot of complains (some nicely worded, some outright whining) about the nerfs to gun damage...Please do not go back to the insane boost to gun damage! I play on nightmare, and with 0/25 points into firearm damage with a regular 2500 damage semi-auto shotgun, my friend and I are having no trouble killing Volatiles, even the alpha ones. There is no reason people should be able to run through the hardest difficulty in the game and 1-shot some of the toughest enemies. I think the reduction in damage was a smart move, and I hope you don't increase it out of pressure from all these angry people.Also, I think some DLCs adding short ""episodes"" in which you play other characters (mostly runners, I'd imagine) in the game, and how they got to where they are at the point that Crane first meets them in the main campaign. For instance, an episode that follows Brecken in the events leading up to securing the Tower and finding other runners and teaching them the skills they'd need, and culminating in the mission Brecken is on but fails and gets injured while Crane (the player) is doing the prologue missions. I think there's a lot of room for cool stuff there.More than anything, though, I'd love to see additional areas of the island opened up. During the Extraction mission in the main campaign when you're ascending the two skyscrapers to face Rais, there are several moments where you can look out over Harran and the outlying regions. There's what seems to be a suburban residential neighborhood, and a crowded urban area with lots of very tall buildings. I'd love to get to those areas and explore! ","Feature requests",1984

If you are not satisfied , you can buy the biggest chupacabra in the chupacabra shop and I started to continue .And a person, who offered this mission , I wish a speedy and painful death from necrotizing hemorrhoids","Feature requests",1994

"2642","That's some really awesome ideas coming from this thread, big thank you to all of you! I will try to comment on some of the ideas here, but there is a lot to go through (which is a very good thing).  We already looked in detail at implementing a hunger and thirst system into the game. In the end, we decided to not include it into the game, because it proved to detract too much from gameplay. The player has quite a lot to keep track of, even without the need to constantly look for food and water. The game will still have you scavenging and competing over air supply drops, just without having to be constantly aware of your hunger and thirst levels. As for your co-op/multiplayer ideas, there are some really strong ideas here, keep them coming. On our side, we will be revealing more about co-op and multiplayer features in the future, stay tuned! CESTQUOICA, Thank you for that extensive post. Some of your ideas (or parts of them) are already present in the game (such as tangible rewards for helping NPCs in random encounters), others we will consider. And it's not an illusion, we really want to hear out the gamers' ideas. After all, we are making the game for you.â€‹Hey just 1 question you guys say you allredy looked in to water/food ideas but how come you say not to it beacous it take away gameplay? But why not put it like an option for players who want it? Like hard and normal and newgame play + you can just add survival. Adding water/food drain and if you get hit by zombie there is a chanse to get infected etc. Why not add eletric/fire/posion resistant zombie that only take dmg from cearten weapon. You Added water 2.0 to game why not make use of it like if you use molotow zombie start runing agens yyou and we can use 2.0 water to make them normal runing one's. add poking fun weapon ? like the Childs zelda alike weapon for crafting, water guns etc like anti-gadoid gun, Make mor option to buggy like add spilers, mor 2 flame insted of 1 diffrent bumpers,etc make zombies have a chanse to grab your foots and drag you down (thinking of pakour zombie) maybe att new take down/finnish move? Maybe add Wheel dmg on buggy like tires can brake/explode? I goot alot of ideas to inprove gameplay and i have not even start talking about online XD.","Feature requests",1997
"2643","I would like to have more customization options, and to see real differences between legendary outfits and regular ones in the 1st person vision(in consoles). Examples: GRE Enforcer, Dragon Ninja outfits. Both of them are different for the other players, but in 1st person vision they are the same thing, GRE Enforcer still looks like juggernaut, and Perfect Gentleman looks like Special Agent Outfit. I want to see a difference between them, even if it's just the color. Beside from that, I wanna SEE the attachments in HeadHunter outfit in the 1st person vision (just like that case on his right leg and the chest attachments, are missing).

"2645","Ok please read before getting too steamed... This is a post I left on STEAM and am passionate about the subject:(ok never mind...there is no 'paste' functioning) :-( Basically I said how disappointed those of us with limited use of hands, eyes, etc. are with Techland (again) I had over 1000hours in DI (half that in DiRT)Did DL 4 times (and 6 more using the 'load' feature. We so looked forward to the Following...and then were greeted by one of the first missions...""TIMED"" (OMG someone with disabilities worst nightmare) Friends that had poor vision were so happy you gave the ability to skip night. However those of us with limited use of our hands were mortified to find a timed mission so close to the start. (3 of my friends had to ask friends with good hands to come over and do that mission for them...yes it is that bad for some of us)I got through after about 9 tries over 2 days) So most of the time I ran rather than drove (my style) but did drive enough to reach level 4 skill (but that was done in short driving sessions) Finally I get the 'end of game warning' Great, no I can wrap up the game and go just explore afterward... WRONG!!!After 2 days, 11 tries...the best I can get is from the lighthouse to a gas station just beyond the tracks...and I have to stop. Why do you insist upon changing the game play? The game would be just as fun w/o timed missions. Normal players can still drive balls to the wall to the dam...and those of us that have to stop and let our hands rest, can do so before continuing on... Far too many game developers completely ignore gamers with limited disabilities...and there are a lot of us. Most gave up on TL after DY. Many did not (obviously I didn't) (but then my disabilities aren't as bad as some I know) Although I do not belong to the gamers with disabilities, I know many that do...and now TL is on the 'do not buy' list... I guess my point is...1) on NORMAL mode, do away with ""timed missions"", ""missions that require night missions that MUST be done to complete the game"" (many of us can do night missions but as side quests) 2) At least talk to people with restrictions/disabilities. You zombie games are great, just poorly implemented for those with restricted or limited disabilities. 3) Remember many of us that have played for decades are finding hand, eye, etc. problems...want us to continue purchasing your games, take us into consideration when programming... No doubt I'll get flamed for this, but it has to be said...we did not give up gaming because of our disabilities...game developers are pushing us away (and with age, our numbers are growing)     ","Feature requests",2000
"2646","Climbing is great...however you need to add the ability to reverse climb... A good example: While climbing the lighthouse in 'following' Many times I went up one hand grip too far. Trying to pin point the next ledge below is nearly impossible because of you adding in the 'one handed look around'. If we can climb by moving forward...why can't we climb back to the next ledge down by hitting the reverse key? (which isn't used during climbing) Removing the 'timed missions"" on normal mode (see other post on this subject) Love the game...dislike the implementation of some of it. (again see my other post on disabled players)Agreed, there were many farms that if we could have just closed the gate...it could have been made into a safe house. Maybe even have a challenge of how many safe houses a player could make: Challenge: Safety nut...""You have created 20 safe houses"" just like in DI/DL add generators and panels...close the  gate, fire up gen, flip switch...  Would love to see the option for ""No respawning.""  That would be more like the zombie apocalypse would be...I mean new zombies could be created, but only if you killed (or someone else killed) a human and didn't do a head shot. Maybe not in a full game, but the following would have been a good time to add this option (and maybe a steam challenge chupacabra number of zombies killed) or areas cleared. If one got bored, they could always uncheck spawning option... Unneeded things...  Airdrops? Most I know never do them unless they happen to be in the path we're taking. Just a thought. ;-)","Feature requests",2001
"2647","Maybe you could add some type of new competitive type of multiplayer mode, away from ""Be The Zombie"". My idea is making a kind of team deathmatch multiplayer mode with a twist: You and various groups of players (At least two teams made of 4 players in each one of them) are in the same map, connected between sessions at a certain time in the game.The objective are dynamic and change a lot of times, for example: A lot of DROPs fall at certain places of the map, one at a time you and your team need to grab them, and the goodies in the box, and deposit them at a certain zone that is now the ""Base"" for your team. You can kill a ""Carrier"" of several Disaster-On-Relief packages, and you can steal them. The carrier will have low health (At least, a 20% lower than the normal bar of health, so he can be killed by firearms and easily beaten up by melee weapons) and a small speed bost while carrying them. This will mean that his partners will protect him, if not, they can lose in a matter of minutes. The team with the most captures wins. Maybe, at the middle of the game, a new objective can appear, being the reward for completing them a box of ammo, or other items that can make the difference between winning and losing.Just an idea, and sorry if you find some grammatical errors in there.","Feature requests",2002

"2658","Dear developer and community First of thank u for such an amazing game like this. I have an idea how we can make the game more interesting for those who wants to play tiny more with guns. I love the melee based game and the shootouts but it does never worth it to shoot. Every time the runners came and I dont know why so fast a one or two shots with shotgun.  So i have two ideas to prove this gameplay without to make the gunplay too op. 1St: a craftable bottle silencer that can only protect the shots for 30 persecnt per Magazine or only for a few shots.  2nd: u make a noisemetre if I choose a gun. This noisemetre gets up with every bullet. If u shoot constantly it arrives a lvl and u hear the screams. In the yellow critic area of the noisemetre it has a Chance that they run into. In the Red crit they are coming for sure. U know already that the runners are coming because of the loud screaming. I think this would be a good idea. To control a little Bit the ""random runners Trolls"" I hope i could give a good advice and PLEASE i would thank u if u could make a little gun friendlier dying light.  Althought the concurrent games will apply sooon with These Systems.

I wish your parkour, combat elements and gore could be implemented in every game from GTA Online to Euro Truck Simulator  I have one suggestion which should be quite easy to implement, which will really add to the tension at night. Alot of times i've just been hiding in houses, closed all the doors and killed virals and zombies from the window or roof. That ruins the immersion a bit, so I would really recommend that some zombies (maybe virals and the runnings ones) could break bust open certain doors, so you can't camp around like a p***y unless you're in a REAL safehouse. If you think it would make the game to difficulty you could implement it only on hard or nightmare difficulty. - Simon","Feature requests",2022

It's quite obvious she was a fan favourite, but by the time we started warming up to her, she was killed off. There's a lot of room for her to be fully fleshed out. So set it before Crane's arrival in the early days of the infection. Make the runners a bigger part of the story, I wanna know how they got there, what they've been through, how Breckon got to be leader, early struggles with Rias' faction.  - Perhaps a continuation on from The Following. Crane is captured by military and he is able to control himself when he becomes a volatile. You introduce this interesting gameplay mechanic where at night you become the hunter, not the hunted. Crane's goal is to cure himself or reverse whats happened to him by helping military scientists - but of course, things don't go to plan.

"2678","Hello, 1st of all, I wanna thank you for all of your work what you are doing for our favorite zobmie game Dying Light ( at least favorite for me  )What I have on my mind is, I would really like to see some bigger survival elements, I mean things like, eat, sleap, drink andsomething like that....I do not really mean to make from Daying Ligh another DayZ or whatever, but something like swap normal game to survival game, where you can normaly play Campaign or The Following but with the survival elements. As well I was thinking about building some Keep or Base how someone already wrote in post (for example like in Fallout 4) and defend it at night or at day, whenever player want(not just at night, I think that would be boring for some people after some time). As well I was thinking to make another difficulty level, Nightmare is just not challenging anymore, it is not that hard to make a bow from DLC(if you have one), but even without it and oneshot zombies in their head, take that arrow back and do the same again. I mean....nightmare is hard from start even in late game, but how I said, not challenging anymore, maybe put perma death to the game, when you die, end of story, that would make game much much much harder, bcs people will keep themself more sharp about every situation. Aaaaaaaaand the biggest thing I was thinking is.......Do another big DLC, like The Following is....pls, pls, pls......The Followoing was epic as heck and we do not know actualy what happend with Kyle Crane when he turned into zombie right ?

I wanna add this....That is one freaking perfect idea, maybe better than some perma-death mode(when you die game is entirely over). It could be like this: when you are bitten, you will get some specific time, depends on what zombie bite/scratch you, or how big is that bite/scratch or how many bites/scratches you have(maybe all options ?  ), in this time you have to get into some specific place( maybe the Breckens Tower or some place in the middle of map, or just two main stations like Breckens Tower and Fiherman Village, just make some save-zones where you can save yourself or your friend in co-op), there you will be able to buy an antizin or some pills what makes you to be normal again, time will dissapear and you can continue in your game( so more far you are from the zone where you can buy those pills, the harder it will be for you to interact with zombies, bcs you might not get it into that save-place in time to be saved). And here are two options what I was thinking when time will get to zero and you turn into zombie, you will just simply turn into zombie and all game is over(you can choose this option ""Game-Over"" in options when you start a new game) or another option is, you just turn, game is over, but game will load from some last checkpoint to make that game at least finish-able, but you will lost alot of experiences or legendary level progress, even lost full legendary level or just drop all your stuff what you had in quick slot and you need to go and get it back or you just lost it forever  Another thing about those pills could be, you can craft them, but you need alot and very rare materials, or you can just simply buy them but for huge amount of money and have them with you(but you could have just one pills, not more) to help yourself or your friend in Co-op if you will get bitten or as well using those pills will have some cooldown, for example 10 or 30 min. or something. I think this is freaking good idea to make that game more real and hard. For example on Game plus in Nightmare mode would be insane  I am sorry for my english and I hope you will understand what I wrote here. Thanks, Thomas.","Feature requests",2034
"2680","Gameplay feature wish list : Taunt: when an enemy is ""hanging back"", tap taunt and the player shouts at the zombie/thug under the aiming-reticle, goading it into charging/attacking immediately at a slight stats disadvantage.  Hold taunt and the player lets loose a huge enemy-attracting bellow, essentially becoming a mobile firecracker -- nearby hostiles focus on you and swarm after you for a few seconds.  A bellow also has a chance of turning several normal Biters/Thugs into berserk Virals.Base-jump: One of Harran's residents has been collecting and re-packing the air-drop chutes.  Now you can purchase and carry one single-use emergency parachute... Leap from tall buildings and hold a key to activate while in free-fall, land by parachute.  Like a free-roam zip-line that allows you to steer left/right as you gradually drift lower.  Would be especially cool if we someday get to play in Harran's urbanized core, among the glass-and-steel high-rises.    (Ahem.)Melee with ranged weapons: because you would in real-life. Just like it is now, firearms and bows wouldn't degrade when fired normally, but if you melee and thump a zombie with a ranged weapon, the gun/bow takes damage and eventually breaks.  You can still shoot a damaged ranged weapon, but it will have decreased accuracy, and there's a chance that firearms may jam when reloading (hold key to un-jam), may misfire (doesn't shoot every time you pull the trigger and wastes/ejects the mis-fired ammo), or may simply blow up in your face.Bash lock perk : almost instantaneous opening of locked chests/crates/doors, but has a significant risk of destroying the contents or buggering the door so that it's permanently jammed shut (until the next time that area loads), and also creates noise which attracts enemies.  Kick a crate or Tackle a door to bash.Silencers: rare/expensive attachable gun mods to give you a brief edge in more ""tactical"" situations.  Silencers take per-use damage each time you fire a shot, rapidly wearing out and becoming audible in a wider and wider area until after about 20 shots they're totally ineffective.  Completely broken silencers condense/direct the sound of a gunshot forward instead, making you audible to enemies at twice the normal distance in the direction that you're shooting.Grappling hooks that ""harpoon"" enemies... hold down the grappling hook key to harpoon a Biter/Viral/Bolter and the enemy rag-dolls and is ""reeled-in"" over about 5-8 seconds (think in terms of environmental hazards like ledges, fire, water, spikes, toxic puddles, etc.), release key to disconnect.  There's always a chance that harpooned enemies may keep their feet and run instead, pulling the player down to ground-level and dragging them through the streets for several seconds, possibly into greater danger.  If two or more players hook a Goon, Night Hunter, or Freak of Nature at the same time, they can immobilize it for a few seconds -- however, there's also a chance that it might go berserk and pull all those players into striking distance instead.  Powerful enemies Bellow (see #1 above) when successfully immobilized, attracting nearby Virals -- so you have to deal with waves of those after each attempt and therefore can't nerf formidable enemies by spamming them with immobilize no matter how well you work as a team.Trip-line perk : Crouch then fire the grappling hook and Kyle digs in his heels and stays put.  Any human-sized enemy that walks into the cable rag-dolls and tumbles to the ground taking damage (with a significant risk of bone-breaks) and becomes momentarily vulnerable to Stomping; enemies that hit the trip-line at a run take double-damage and have a small chance of dying from the fall.  Large enemies or vehicles crossing the trip-line have a small chance of tripping/rolling but a large chance of reversing the effect (at best leaving the player vulnerable on the ground for a few seconds, or at worst dragging them through the streets for a few seconds.)  A second player can re-enforce a player already doing a trip-line by gripping them or their line, reducing the odds of being dragged by a large enemy/vehicle by half.Slick Traps : dash one on a rooftop, and anything pursuing you into that area at a pace faster than a walk will rag-doll and slide off in the direction that it's inertia is carrying it.  Will also affect you if you return to the area before the slick dissipates, but you can walk slowly through it without falling, or slide through it at a run.  Off-balance enemies that slide into you can knock you off your feet and do light damage.Plasma Packet : like camouflage in reverse... raid local hospitals/clinics/blood-banks, and then douse enemies with plasma to make other infected mistake them for extra-tasty humans.  Also over-stimulates nearby biters turning one into a berserk Viral every few seconds until effect wears off.  Has a risk of making you extra-attractive to infected if you get caught in the splash-zone.Crash Mat perk : grab a zombie/thug at the edge of a roof and it cushions your fall to street level like a ""portable"" trash pile.  Insta-kills your crash mat on impact, and has a chance of automatically applying ""camouflage"" if performed on a zombie, or ""plasma"" if performed on a thug.  Creates noise which attracts enemies.Put-pocket perk : stash explosives in Biter pockets while camouflaged, then trigger all simultaneously via car-trap remote.  (Combine with firecrackers or a plasma packet to covertly move a swarm of explosives into range of powerful enemies/vehicles/structures.)  Any put-pocketed Biters that catch fire or trip and fall while ""armed"" have a chance of spontaneously detonating.Toad-jacking: camouflage up behind a Toad then do a ""Take Down"" to knock it to it's knees and grapple it's head with your left hand.  You now have a turret... every tap of the ""attack"" key punches the toad with your right hand and causes it to spit.  Projectiles do knock-back damage to anything that they hit, plus intense acid damage.  Releasing the Toad automatically kills it, but get clear quickly - they'll explode in an acid-nova after a few seconds, showering the entire area. Gameplay things that currently break immersion :The game manages huge crowds of zombies by dividing them into two groups: background zombies which are essentially just animated environmental decorations, and foreground zombies which are ai-controlled enemies.  As you eliminate foreground zombies, you can see the game picking the nearest background zombies and converting them into foreground zombies.  This works well for almost every situation and is a necessary convention as it limits resource usage and keeps the game running smoothly.  However, it does break immersion in some instances.  For example, if you're in a really crowded area (like the suspension bridge) and toss a molotov about 6 car-lengths away, it can land in a dense clot of zombies and do absolutely nothing.   Why not quickly compute hit-points vs. molotov damage for that area, and then (without assigning AI to the zombies in the splash-zone) have them play though animations and either die or survive while remaining as background zombies? Minor graphical things that break immersion...Player shadows: It's super-weird that you don't have one when the person/thing right next to you does.   Plus, spotting zombie/thug shadows can save your life, so spotting your own shadow might scare the carp out of you at times.More obvious vapours/smoke visible from a distance when green/smelly zombies pop.  If you're standing right close to them, it seems like you're caught in a huge puffball cloud, but when you're outside the spash-damage range you don't see anything at all.  That seems sort of ""incomplete"".Actual Reflections.  I'm not saying put them all over the place and kill performance, but it wouldn't hurt to have them in a few key locations.  Seeing the reflection of a monster sneaking up behind you is a staple of the horror genre, and besides, not every mirror in Harran can be broken. Non-flat water.  Just in the area immediately around the player for close-up detail - there should be wave deformations.  Swimming underwater is great, but swimming right at the surface and seeing a perfectly flat polygon with a bump-map inches from your nose seems a little ""graphically dated"", especially when the rest of the game looks so awesome.   See Crysis1 and Witcher3 for great water.And... as a silly notion for future content...   Dying Light is great when it's being serious, but it really shines when it gets a little zany...  Why not go a little over-the-top crazy with some genre-blending DLC...  We've got a zombie apocalypse well underway in the Dying Light universe, but what if yet another one of Harran's crackpots tries to fix the problem and temporarily creates a time-rift in the middle of that...?   Suddenly, you've got all manner of additional epic weirdness to contend with... an alien invasion (think fast Skitter/Xenomorph-style wall-crawling aliens, and zombified variants), dinosaurs and zombie dinosaurs roaming the countryside, mechanical monstrosities from the far-future's machine apocalypse, etc.  Zombies which were previously our greatest threat could become a cool form of geurilla resistance if played against the new enemies, AND it would add a bunch of neat new enemy/weapon/vehicle types.  Maybe it's real, maybe Kyle just slipped and hit his head and he's actually in Lina's sick-room where someone's been playing cheesy DVDs for him -- but either way, it would be oh so much fun.   (""Dylight Savings Time"", anyone?) ;D Anyways, thanks to you guys and gals at Techland for an awesome game, and special thanks for bringing it to GOG.com - never would have tried it if it hadn't ended up there!Edited October 14, 2016 by Species8472.5b","Feature requests",2035

"2685","Aloha Pawel, I have a few ideas for a game-mode/expansion that players would love.  I don't know anything about making games so please let me know if it would be too hard. 1. Switch ""Change Outfit"" at stash to ""Change Character"" - 4 characters each with a different bonus - +50/%20 weapon handling or +Firearms damage similar to Dead Island 2. Add a community defense element.  Npc's you meet outside of the place you choose to call home return with you and can be taken as companions on missions.  With each passing day, your community's resources like water and food diminish - the player must make runs for drops that now contain food bundles along with antizin etc... Have PVP and defend you home from raiders, PVP raiders can kill your community members for good and lower your supplies to 0 Npc community's can be raided and slowly repopulate. Must also defend base from occasional herds hordes of zombies.  Maybe add different places that can be overthrown each with better and better defenses like rais's base etc... just a few ideas for a mode similar to tower defense horde PVP survival I know would be a hit. These are just sporadic ideas I'd love to chat about sometime.  I am interested in making this a reality at any cost.  I think Dying Light has the best foundation and is the best game I have played and this would take it to a whole new level of popularity.   Defending a place that feels like you have worked hard for is an irreplaceable rush that gamers crave.  That feeling of knowing it could all be lost will keep people playing. Respectfully, Vinson Jones","Feature requests",2040
"2686","Hello Techland ! On the first hand, thanks for Dying Light. It is a really good game, my favorite since he come on the market.Well, i am here to show you my ideas for some DLC or even Dying Light 2, and I am sorry if someone has already wrote it, but popular ideas will be used .  First, for free DLC (things that can be cool for everyone) - New animations for weapons, just like maces, or two handed weapons. Mister Crane can do more than just two moves i think. Long Swords are boring to play, he cut on the left, he cut on the right, and can't do something more. Maces have just one move, if we don't count the special attacks. - Craft your own skin for your weapons. It will be a good idea to have your own colors on your weapons, but only when you already find a skin. Like if you find a Camo skin for a weapon, you can add it to another weapon, nothing more.  Paying DLC  -New story, with more interaction with NPC, like in the Following, but for each one. Ezgi is so hot ! Damn ! If you can be friend with some runners may be add, because we fight for the same things, but i will say more after. For the story, i think something who need like 15 or 20 hours to end will be good. And maybe another map, but this will be hard to do, a map who can have Buggys and Parkour. -Survivor difficulty. Same challenges at the Nightmare, but with more interactions with NPC's, like defending a house on the night, or even, something that i can only dream, add a crafted house, or craft zone. Maybe a fixed point, somewhere, when you can create your house, add some protections, like spikes, and UV things. But you have to recolt a lot of ressources for this, i really think have your own house on the game will be cool.-Make the runners run ! Most of the time, they don't move their arsses from safe place, you are running alone on the night, nobody is here, outside, do some crazy chupacabra like you, but they always say they are runners.  If you found them fighting  for their life can be cool, like some Rahim running away from volatiles or night hunters, and you are here to save him. On the night, you are really lonely, so, add some real runners will be  a good idea i think.-Like other says, add more accessories for guns. Like silencors or scopes, this will be really cool but really hard to find, like on some military places, hiden or on some dead bodies. -Add more scary zombies. Yes, they are already the bosses, nighthunters, but maybe, see some new faces, new zombies who appear sometimes, who totally dominate volatiles, just like they eat everything and everyone,zombies, humans, animals ... The ultimate hunters who fear nothing and no one, who didn't even care of UV or safe places. Like I told earlier, some zombies who can try to break on safe places, but only them, because they are the stronger. Only appear with other players with you(impossible to kill alone), you have to attack some parts first on order to defeat him. Like Right Leg > Left Arm > Back > Head. Also give amazing loots for everyone when killed.-Put more legendary weapons, but really hard to craft, add 4 expcalibur to make a new one you can only find blueprints of them, and have to delete some really good weapons to create them. And they can't be broken. Like if you have to loose 4 swords with more than 5 K of damage to create one who is really cool and really strong. But can't add blueprints or anything else on it, or it will be too strong. Or make them appear when you kill the ultimate zombie, like I say on the top.  This is all my ideas for the solo / multi players. I got nothing for Be the Zombie mode, because it's not my favorite mode, so I let others who love it put their ideas.Thanks for reading            VieuxMonsieur (OldMan) ","Feature requests",2041

"2692","It would be amazing if you could go and let yourself go into the buggy instead of teleport into it. If there would be some kind of old carbine or a sniper. It would be more realistic if the head was less easy to explode cause thats really easy. It would be awsome if you could slice the head in half. It would be awsome if the grappling hook was not overpowered. It would be awsome if techland would be using the zombies from the beta cause the looked a lot scarier and the zombies that we have now look very boring. It would be awsome if you could trip over stuff or maybe hit a wall at parkouring, that would make it realisticer. It would be cool if there where more healing spots like your head or your upperbody or your legg. It would be cool if there was morphine to heal your legs when you get falldamage. It would be amazing if they could fix the volatiles when there running because sometimes I see that they are stuck. It would be cool that if you shoot at an enemies crotch that he would be screaming like hell and that the zombies where gonna eat him alive. It would be scarier if they would fix the  mouth of the zombies cause they could add blood to It or something like that. It would ve awsome if the enemies at a airdrop had guns too because they never have guns at an airdrop. It would be cool if the zombies weren't spazzing around if you trew/shot some kind of explosive at em. It would be cool if you could shoot there brains out cause you can't do that in the game. It would be really nice if they could change the gunshot from every gun in the game cause they sound nothing like real gunshots to me, they could use some of the gunshots from zombiU or the last of us. It would be awsome that When you hit a zombie to the left that the zombie ectually falls to the left, like a runner like when its runner towards me and I kill it then the dead body will go right through me. It would be more realistic that if you shoot a zombie with a assault rifle or pistol that the head wouldn't explode.it would be cool if there was some way to check your watch. It would be just dream for me if they could just make a gamemode that was really just realistic.Edited January 5 by Turbo","Feature requests",2047
"2693","Hello techland!I really hope you lot are still around, i love your game and all its offered till now, but I was wondering if anything else is coming in the future? Dying Light 2? a new expansion maybe? I understand a couple of the endings of The Following was a bit... Final (keeping it spoiler free!) But That doesnt mean it has to end there right?Onward to suggestions!1) Honestly a few new firearms would be much appreciated. I find myself wanting a sniper more often then anything else, or even a launcher as we have seen them used by enemies...4 2) Weapon customization. Now dont lynch me, i know we have that for the melee and to an extent the bows... but i mean like... Modding the rifles. Mod slots, Attachments, camos... Id really like to be able to pick off zeds with a silent firearm instead of relying on my bow. The bows cool. Id still use it... but like... i really want a sniper or a gun that doesnt draw in vollies and virals. 3) Maybe a new story arc? With a different lead? This last one is prolly the most... taxing. A female lead would be amazing, but thats not what im getting at. I just want /more/ you know? I still play but at this point idk what to do other then help others lol. Noted that game making is hard, expensive, and time consuming.

"2694","HEALTH: When you lose some health you will also lose some of your ability to perform well. With that I mean: If you lose 25% health and you have maxed out agility, it is as though your agility level is below 12.at 50% below 5, at 75%  as though you are just starting.  LEGEND: Add a new option, maybe something along the lines of DEXTERITY and the ability to replace one of the legend tree with that option. Under dexterity something along the lines of: Nimble hands ii, 75% chance of finding extra loot, faster at searching, better at lockpicking, faster at using camo and better at crafting.  BACKPACK: More realistic at the amount you can carry, because at the moment you can carry an insane amount goodies.  PLAYERS STASH: If you put some of your stuff in safe house A, it should not be in the other safe house. More realistic?  CONSUMABLES: The ability to store consumables, especially in times of plenty.  BLUE LOCKERS: Please do not put coffee and other easily found items in blue lockers. I normally expect more than that as I have found 2 tubs while looting infected. Cash will be useful, but not: Cosmetics, Cigarettes, and of course Coffee  NIGHTMARE MODE: Make the infected a bit more aggressive especially some of the female infected as quite often they suddenly stop raise the hands to their face and turn around, or, make the male infected act the same.","Feature requests",2049

"2706","Difficulty level: Mae the level fixed after you have complete airdrop, by that I mean if you complete airdrop on easy then that is what the rest of the game will be in.  Infected agression: Make them want to eat you instead of them standing in a group discussing where to go, yes they are harder to kill on nightmare but they are not agressive enough it is as though some of them are vegetarians, well only for a short time at least.","Feature requests",2061
"2707","SMG Ammo: Currently, on Normal difficulty, you can purchase high quantities of ammo from merchants. Problem is, SMG ammo (and bolts) can only be bought at The Following merchants, and not at base game merchants.Considering the fact that base game merchants sell SMGs (engraved barrel smg, an example) tells me it shouldn't be that difficult to include that part in the code. Due to matchmaking restrictions from game mods and negligible gameplay change (because you can already buy enough ammo to survive a whole night of constant shooting) I think it doesn't impact balance much, if at all, while still enabling players to freely use SMGs in the base game maps.Take notice that SMGs are very fun to use as they're quite different from military rifles, and not enabling players like me to purchase unlimited quantities of ammo for them just restraints the fun.","Feature requests",2062
"2708","Recently I was having a problem getting my save file to become a New Game+. I reached out to the support team and we went around and around. I finally was able to fix it myself but it took finding the Chemical Storage quest. When I had ANY of the DLC quests active it would not allow me to do the New Game+. Because of this glitch and what I had to do in order to fix it I believe that somewhere in the programming there is an issue with ANY DLC and starting the game over as New Game+.","Feature requests",2063

"2711","Dying Light was a perfect game in my opinion, so I don't really have much suggestions for the sequel, because I know Techland already knows what they are doing with this genre and this series. So i just have a request, Can we please have a 3rd Person Camera option for the sequel. I know that means you have to animate the main player character to accommodate the new camera POV but man nothing would make me happier than to see my character as he parkours, drive vehicles and chop zombies to bits. Plus having this option would allow you to have more customization options for your character.","Feature requests",2066
"2712","four gadgets that I think would be awesome in dying light.1. A Boomerang that you can upgrade that auto tracks up to 3 targets and has a 50% base chance to cut of limbs or the head of Biters, Virals. Also if there is only one zombie (such as a goon.) and you have the upgrade you can hit him with all three hits at one time. and as long as the boomerang durability runs out and break. it will try to return to you. but if it hits an impassable wall it will just break. and you will have to build a new one. and can also be upgraded/built as a fire/toxic/impact/electricity as well as slowing.2. A Sentry Turret. I was thinking of a turret that auto fires on enemies you place it on the ground. the level one turret can only fire in one direction at a 35 degree radius of where you place it. (only 1 turrets can be out at the same time) a level 2 it can fire anywhere in front of it in a 180 degree arc and one turret can be active and one on standby until the other turret is destroyed or recovered by you. and does more damage and shoots more bullets in each burst and can fire faster. A level 3 turrets. 2 active turrets can be deployed at the same time. they can stick to walls and ceilings for 60 seconds before falling to a position on the floor. can fire in a full 360 degree arc. can have armor piercing, explosive, incendiary, shock, and impact bullets. has more armor and health and can be recovered from a distance for less parts than what you built it with.3. a Sentry Bot. pretty much the same as a sentry turret. except it can move with you and has basic climbing and jumping abilities and can stick to walls. maximum deployed sentry Bots would be 2. can be recovered for less parts. instead of a blueprint to instantly build stronger ones. it will have one level bar that raises as it POWERS, AGILITY, and SURVIVES. that more or longer it does the more upgrades it gets by itself.4. Would have to be a mech or power armor that can be used in the city. It might be a bit much to ask for an upgradeable suit that you can wear and you can customize and upgrade. plus you would take no fall damage. I think that this item would have to be an extremely hard to get item after the main story. but can be used in the following or other DLC areas with some restrictions.I would just like more wacky and weird ways to take out zombies. It is very fun. but after you 1000th Volatile kill you want more ways to have fun. I think you the Developers did an awesome job on this game. it is a lot of fun. And I hope you will take my suggestions seriously. hmm I just thought of something else. what about a drone that can fly with you and help you out. for every battery you give it it can fly for another 2 hours of real time.anyways have a good day. And I can't wait for Dying Light 2 ","Feature requests",2067
"2713","One thing I noticed last night that I would really like implemented is during co-op it should be the hosts decision to skip any cut scenes, not anyone playing. I suggest this as during my stream last night someone joined and then skipped a big part of the beginning, which did annoy me and the viewers also, now I will have to play private by invite only to stop players doing this which is a shame.","Feature requests",2068

"2716","Some games have this, but for some reason it's not very common: Equipment / items such as chalk, spray paint, or glow-sticks, used to mark an area already explored / visited. Some would argue that already-open toolboxes, chests, and the like is sufficient clue, but marking a building wall with an X would save time. This would be a very nifty feature in large open-world games such as this, where maps are complex.","Feature requests",2071

Why not Steam? I mean, aside from the OBVIOUS problem that Steam has woefully insufficient coverage of games on Linux platforms. The ONLY reason I operate Windows platforms is because [game] developers ignore the intelligent market. Linux file systems are infectable only by IDIOTS [ignoring root permission warnings], and the file systems don't fragment. As a hardline computer scientist, I must say Windows platforms BLOW.

"2728","Hi ! I don't know ift's still usefull to post anything here but since I played the game recently, and what I would suggest would be to rebalance some stuff : i would think about most of the explosives (toxic one and frag one are pretty useless at high level and in nightmare, while explosive ones keep blowing a lot of zombie at once) and what I really wanted to ask you to do : rebalance special arrow, if you read please do something about it, there's 2 way to get these : bozak trials, or buying ranger dlc (i did both) and the arrow you get are useless :/ Fire and eletrical have 0 dmg (at one time i tried to know how many incendiary arrow were necessary to kill one of the strognest bitter, after 15 incendiary arrow and him still walking aroundi stopped and finished him with a knife, but for you to understand how bad it is : even the strongest bitter need only 2 or 3 molotov to die), eletrical stun them a bit a least but not for a time long enough to be really usefull and it won't stun enough of them even if theyre packed, and the explosives are fun but they'll do only dmg to one target cause the explosion has a small radius and the first one launch the ennemies if the air so the 2nd and 3rd explosion will affect only the ennemi you hit (and if you aimed at the ground the explosions will be on the ground but the zombie will be throw away so the 2nd and 3rd won't hit too). The toxic bolt of the crossbow got the same problem, but since the 2 other bolt and actually usefull it's a lesser problem. It's really frustrating when some stuff become useless, it become even worse hwen you realise that your explosives who need some good component to craft is a lot less efective than a molotov who needs almost nothing and that you can craft till level 1.Ty for reading, sorry if i don't speak english well i'm French.
