# TextMiner
## Turning messy data into tidy data

Over the past 10-15 years text mining has seen massive expansion both in practical applications and research theory. Several, quite diverse areas such as mining student feedback in educational domains and mining customer emails/feedback for satisfaction or pinpointing problems with products have all benefited from this automated approach.  There are many reasons for this explosive growth but the main factor is that the majority of human knowledge and experience is in the form of the written word and not structured databases. 

we show how extracting user sentiment by text mining posts from several popular gaming forums can be used to identify user experience problems and issues that can adversely effect the enjoyment and gaming experience for the customers. The users posts are preprocessed and parsed, we label the posts as negative, positive or neutral in terms of sentiment. We then identify key areas for game play improvement based on the frequency counts of keywords and phrases used by the forum members.
