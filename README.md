# TextMiner
Turning messy data into tidy data

Over the past 10-15 years text mining has seen massive expansion both in practical applications and research theory. Several, quite diverse areas such as mining student feedback in educational domains\cite{Romero2010,Kumar2015} and mining customer emails/feedback for satisfaction or pinpointing problems with products have all benefited from this automated approach \cite{Liao2010}.  There are many reasons for this explosive growth but the main factor is that the majority of human knowledge and experience is in the form of the written word and not structured databases.
